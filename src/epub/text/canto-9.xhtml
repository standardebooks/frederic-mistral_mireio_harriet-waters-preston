			<p>
				<span>All sorrowfully droop the lotus-trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heart-sick to their hives withdraw the bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of the heath with savoury sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with milk-thistle. Water-lilies greet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kingfishers blue that to the vivary hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “Have you seen Mirèio?” is their cry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Ramoun and his wife by the fireside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are sitting, lost in grief, and swollen-eyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at their hearts the bitterness of death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Doubtless,” they said, “her reason wandereth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, what a mad and wretched maid it is!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, what a heavy, cruel downfall this!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, dire disgrace! Our beauty and our hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So with the last of trampers to elope!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled with a gypsy! And who shall discover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The secret hole of this kidnapping lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he the shameless one concealèd hath?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as they spake, they knit their brows in wrath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now came the cupbearer with ass and pannier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the threshold, in his wonted manner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good-morrow,” Jane. “I’m come,” he said, “to seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The labourer’s lunch.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-83" id="noteref-83" epub:type="noteref">83</a> And Ramoun could but wreak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His anguish on him. “Go, you cursèd churl!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’m as a cork-tree barked, without my girl!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet hark ye, cupbearer, upon your track</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the fields like lightning go you back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid the ploughmen and the mowers all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit ploughs and scythes, the harvesters let fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sickles, and their shepherds too,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Forsake their flocks, and instant come to me!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, fleeter than a goat, the faithful man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er stony fallow and red clover ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threaded holm-oaks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-84" id="noteref-84" epub:type="noteref">84</a> on long declivities,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaped o’er the roads along the base of these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now already scents the sweet perfume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of new-mown hay, and the blue-tufted bloom</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of tall lucerne descries; and presently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The measured sweep of the long scythes hears he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lusty mowers bending in a row</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholds, and grass by the keen steel laid low</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In verdant swaths⁠—ever a pleasant sight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And children, and young maidens, with delight</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Raking the hay and in cocks piling it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While crickets, that before the mowers flit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hark to their singing. Also, farther on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ash-wood cart, by two white oxen drawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where a deft cartman, piles the well-cured grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By armfuls high and higher, till the mass</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rises about his loins, and so conceals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rails, the cart-beam, and the very wheels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when the cart moves on, with the hay trailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seems like some unwieldy vessel sailing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now the cartman rises, and descries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The runner, and “Hold, men! there’s trouble!” cries;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And all his aids, who in great forkfuls carry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him the hay, do for a moment tarry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wipe their streaming brows; and mowers rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scythe-back carefully upon the breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whet the edge, as they the plain explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Phoebus wings his burning arrows o’er.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Began the rustic messenger straightway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hear men, what our good master bade me say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ‘Cupbearer,’ was his word, ‘upon your track</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the fields like lightning go you back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid the ploughmen and the mowers all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit ploughs and scythes, the harvesters let fall</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Their sickles, and the shepherds hastily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsake their flocks, and hither come to me!’ ”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, fleeter than a goat, the faithful man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the rich, madder-growing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-85" id="noteref-85" epub:type="noteref">85</a> hillocks ran⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Althen’s bequest⁠—and saw on every hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gold of perfect ripeness tinge the land,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And centaury-starred fields, and ploughmen bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above their ploughs and on their mules intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And earth, awakened from her winter-sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shapeless clods upturned from furrows deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wagtails frisking o’er; and yet again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hearken to what our master saith, good men!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Cupbearer,’ was his word, ‘upon your track</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the fields like lightning go you back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid the ploughmen and the mowers all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit ploughs and scythes, the harvesters let fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sickles, and the shepherds hastily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsake their flocks, and hither come to me!’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the stout runner, fleeter than the goats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashed through the pieces waving with wild-oats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fosses o’erleaped with meadow-flowers bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in great yellow wheat-fields passed from sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where reapers forty, sickle each in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a devouring fire fall on the land,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And strip her mantle rich and odorous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From off her breast, and, ever gaining thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wolves upon their prey, rob, hour by hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth of her gold, and summer of her flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While in the wake of each, in ordered line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls the loose grain, like tendrils of the vine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the sheaf-binders, ever on the watch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dropping wheat in handfuls deftly catch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And underneath the arm the same bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, so gathering, they have enow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, pressing with the knee, they tightly bind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lastly fling the perfect sheaf behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Twinkle the sickles keen like swarming bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or laughing ripple upon sunny seas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where flounders are at play. Erect and tall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rough beards blent, in heaps pyramidal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sheaves by hundreds rise. The plain afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shows like a tented camp in days of war;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even like that which once arose upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our own Beaucaire, in days how long withdrawn!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When came a host of terrible invaders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great Simon, and all the French crusaders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led by a legate, and in fierce advance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Count Raymond slaughtered and laid waste Provence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And here, with gleanings falling from her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a merry gleaner strays and lingers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or in the warm lea of the stacks of corn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ’mid the canes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-86" id="noteref-86" epub:type="noteref">86</a> drops languidly, o’erborne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By some long look, that e’en bewilders her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because Love also is a harvester.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet again the master’s word⁠—“Go back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like lightning, cupbearer, upon your track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid the ploughmen and the mowers all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit ploughs and scythes, the harvesters let fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sickles, and the shepherds instantly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsake their flocks, and hither come to me!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fleeter than a goat sped on his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faithful soul, straight through the olives gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On, on, like a north-eastern gale descending</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the vineyards, and the branches rending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, away in Crau, the waste, the lonely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold him, where the partridge whirreth only;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, still remote, discovers he the flocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tranquilly lying under the dwarf-oaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the chief-shepherd, with his helpers young,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For noontide rest about the heather flung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little wagtails hopping at their ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er sheep that ruminate unmoved by these.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And slowly, slowly sailing o’er the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diaphanous vapours, light and white, sees he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deems that up in heaven some fair saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gliding too near the sun, is stricken faint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the aerial heights, and hath let fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her convent-veil. And still the herald’s call:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hark, shepherds, to the master’s word⁠—‘Go back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like lightning, cupbearer, upon your track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid the ploughmen and the mowers all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quit ploughs and scythes, the reapers too let fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sickles, and the shepherds instantly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsake their flocks, and hither come to me!’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the scythes rested and the ploughs were stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forty highland reapers each his blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let fall, and rushed as bees on new-found wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsake the hive, begin their wanderings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, by the din of clanging cymbals led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gather them to a pine. So also fled</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The labourers one and all; the wagoners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they who tended them; the rick-builders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gleaners, and shepherds, and of sheaves the heapers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Binders of sheaves, rakers, mowers, and reapers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mustered them at the homestead. There, heart-sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And silent, on the grass-grown treading-floor,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The master and his wife sat down to bide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coming of the hands; who, as they hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither, much marvelled at the strange behest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So calling them from toil, and who addrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These words unto old Ramoun, drawing near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou sentest for us, master. We are here.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Ramoun raised his head, and thus replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The great storm alway comes at harvest-tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However well-advised, as we advance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We must, poor souls, all stumble on mischance:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot say it plainer. Friends, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let each tell what he knows, without delay!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lauren de Gout came forward first. Now he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had failed no single year since infancy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His quivered sickle from the hills to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down into Arles when ears were yellowing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brown as a church-stone, he, with weather-stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ancient rock the sea-waves charge in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun might scorch, the northwest wind might roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this old king of reapers evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was first at work. And now with him there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven rough and stalwart boys who bore his name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him with one voice the harvesters did make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their chief, and justly: therefore thus he spake:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If it be true that, when the dawning sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is ruddy, there is rain or snow close by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then what I saw this very morn, my master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Presageth surely sorrow and disaster.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So may God stay the earthquake! But as night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled westward, followed by the early light,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And wet with dew as ever, I the men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First summoned briskly to their toil again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then myself, my sleeves uprolling gayly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bent me to mine own task, as I do daily;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the first stroke wounded thus my hand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thing which hath not happened, understand,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For thirty years.” His fingers then he showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the deep gash, wherefrom the blood yet flowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then groaned, more piteously than before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio’s parents; while a lusty mower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One Jan Bouquet, a knight of La Tarasque</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Tarascon, a hearing rose to ask.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A rough lad he, yet kind and comely too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None with such grace in Condamino threw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pike and flag, and never merrier fellow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang Lagadigadèu’s <i xml:lang="oc">ritournello</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-87" id="noteref-87" epub:type="noteref">87</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the gloomy streets of Tarascon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, once a year, they ring with shout and song,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And brighten up with dances and are blithe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He might have been a master of the scythe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could he have held the straight, laborious path;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, when the fête-days came, farewell the swath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And welcome revels underneath the trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And orgies in the vaulted hostelries,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And bull-baitings, and never-ending dances!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A very roisterer he who now advances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With, “As we, master, in long sweeps were mowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hailed a nest of francolines, just showing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a tuft of tares; and, as I bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the pendent grass, with the intent</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To count the fluttering things, what do I see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But horrible red ants⁠—oh, misery!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In full possession of the nest and young!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three were then dead. The rest, with vermin stung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their little heads out of the nest extended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though, poor things, they cried to be defended;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But a great cloud of ants, more venomous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than nettles, greedy, eager, furious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Them were o’erwhelming even then; and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaning upon my scythe right pensively,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could hear, far off, the mother agonize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over their cruel fate, with piteous cries.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This tale of woe, following upon the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is a lance-thrust to father and to mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The worst foreboding seemeth justified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, as a tempest in the hot June-tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathering silently, ascends the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weather darkening ever, till the glare</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of lightning shows in the northeast, and loud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peal follows peal, another left the crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One Lou Marran. It was a name renowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all the farms when winter-eves came round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And labourers, chatting while the mules were stalled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pulling lucerne from the rack, recalled</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What things befell when first this man was hired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the lights for lack of oil expired.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seed-time it was, and every other man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was opening up his furrow save Marran;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, hanging back, eyed coulter, tackle, share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he the like had seen not anywhere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till the chief-ploughman spake: “Here is a lout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To plough for hire! Why, a hog with his snout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I wager would work better!”⁠—“I will take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy bet,” said Lou Marran; “and be the stake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three golden louis! Either thou or I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master, that sum will forfeit presently.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let blow the trumpet!” Then the ploughmen twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In two unswerving lines upturn the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making for the chosen goal⁠—two poplars high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun-rays gild the ridges equally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the labourers call out, “Well done!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy furrow, chieftain, is a noble one;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet, sooth to say, so straight the other is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One might an arrow shoot the length of this.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lou Marran was winner⁠—he who here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the baffled council doth appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All pale, his bitter evidence to bear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Comrades, as I was whistling, at my share,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not long ago, methought the land was rough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we would stretch, the day to finish off;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, lo! my beasts with fear began to quake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bristled their hairy sides, their ears lay back.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They stopped; and, with dazed eyes, I saw all round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The field-herbs fade, and wither to the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I touch my pair. Baiardo sadly eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His master, but stirs not. Falet applies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His nostril to the furrow. Then I lash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their shins; and, all in terror, off they dash,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the ash-wood beam⁠—the beam, I say⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is rent, and yoke and tackle borne away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then grew I pale, and all my breath was gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, seized as with a strong convulsion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ground my jaws. A dreadful shudder grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon me⁠—and my hair upraised, I knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thistle-down is raised by the wind’s breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the wind sweeping over me was Death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Mother of God!” Mirèio’s mother cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In torture, “do thou in thy mantle hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine own sweet child!” and on her knees she dropped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lifted eyes and parted lips: yet stopped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere any word was spoken, for she saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Antéume, shepherd-chief and milker, draw</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hurriedly toward them. “And why,” he was panting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Was she the junipers untimely haunting?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, the ring entering, his tale he told.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This morn, as we were milking in the fold⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So early that above the bare plain showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sky yet hobnailed with the stars of God⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A soul, a shadow, or a spectre swept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the way. The dogs all silence kept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if afraid, and the sheep huddled close.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought I⁠—who scarce have time, as master knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever an Ave in the church to offer⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Speak, soul, if thou art blest. If not, go suffer!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then came a voice I knew⁠—it never varies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Will none go with me to the holy Maries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the shepherds?’ Ere the word was said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afar over the plain the voice had fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou believe it, master?⁠—it was she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio!” Cried the people, “Can it be?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It was herself!” the shepherd-chief replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I saw her in the star-light past me glide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not, surely, as she was in other days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lifting up a wan, affrighted face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby she was a living soul, I knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stung by some exquisite anguish too.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this dread word, the labourers groan, and wring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each other’s horny palms. “But who will bring,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stricken mother began wildly shrieking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“<em>Me</em> to the saints? My bird I must be seeking!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My partridge of the stony field,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I must o’ertake, wherever she has fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if the ants attack her, then these teeth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall grind them and their hill! If greedy Death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dare touch my darling rudely, then will I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break his old, rusty scythe, and she shall fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away across the jungle!” Crying thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jano Mario fled delirious</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Back to the home; while Ramoun order gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Cartman, set up the cart-tilt, wet the nave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oil the axle, and without delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harness Moureto.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-88" id="noteref-88" epub:type="noteref">88</a> We go far to-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And it is late.” The mother, in despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mounted the cart; and more and more the air</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Resounded with the transports of her woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O pretty dear! O wilderness of Crau!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O endless, briny plains! O dreadful sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be kind, I pray you, to the fainting one!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for her⁠—the accursèd witch Taven⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lured my darling into her foul den,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And poured before her, as I know right well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her philters and her potions horrible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made her drink⁠—now may the demons all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lured <abbr>St.</abbr> Anthony upon her fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drag her body o’er the rocks of Baux!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the unhappy soul lamented so,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her tones were smothered by the cart’s rude shaking;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the farm-labourers, a last look taking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see if none were coming o’er the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned slowly, sadly, to their toil again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While swarms of gnats, the idle, happy things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled the green walks with sound of humming wings.</span>
