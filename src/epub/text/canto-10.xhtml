			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Listen to me, good people of Provence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countrymen one and all, from Arles to Vence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Vanensolo even to Marseilles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, if the heat oppress you, come, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Durancolo banks, and, lying low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear the maid’s tale, and weep the lover’s woe!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The little boat, in Andreloun’s control,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parted the water silent as a sole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while the enamoured maiden whom I sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herself on the great Rhône adventuring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the urchin sat, and scanned the wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intently, with a dreamy eye and grave,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till the boy-boatman spake: “Now knewest thou ever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young lady, how immense is the Rhône river?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt Camargue and Crau might holden be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right noble jousts! That is Camargue!” said he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That isle so vast it can discern, I deem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the seven mouths of the Arlesian stream.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The rose-lights of the morn were beauteous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the river, as he chatted thus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the tartanes, with snowy sails outswelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tranquilly glided up the stream, impelled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the light breeze that blew from off the deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As by a shepherdess her milk-white sheep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And all along the shore was noble shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By feathery ash and silver poplar made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose hoary trunks the river did reflect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And giant limbs with wild vines all bedeckt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ancient vines and tortuous, that upbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their knotty, clustered fruit the waters o’er.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Majestically calm, but wearily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as he fain would sleep, the Rhône passed by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like some great veteran dying. He recalls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Music and feasting in Avignon’s halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And castles, and profoundly sad is he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lose his name and waters in the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the enamoured maiden whom I sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had leaped ashore; and the boy, tarrying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to say, “The road that lies before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is thine! The Saints will guide thee to the door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their great chapel,” took his oars in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swiftly turned his shallop from the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Under the pouring fire of the June sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like lightning doth Mirèio fly and fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>East, west, north, south, she seems to see extend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One weary plain, savannas without end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With glimpses of the sea, and here and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tamarisks lifting their light heads in air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Golden-herb, samphire, shave-grass, soda⁠—these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone grow on the bitter prairies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the black bulls in savage liberty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoice, where the white horses all are free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To roam abroad and breast the briny gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or air surcharged with sea-fog to inhale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now o’er all the marsh, dazzling to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soars an immeasurable vault of blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intense, profound. The only living thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A solitary gull upon the wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hermit-bird whereof the shadow falls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the desert meres at intervals,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or red-legged chevalier, or hern, wild-eyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With crest of three white plumes upraised in pride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon the sun so beats upon the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the poor, weary wanderer is fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To loose and lift her folded neckerchief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So from the burning heat to find relief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet grows the torment ever more and more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun ascending higher than before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, as a starvèd lion’s eye devours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Abyssinian desert that he scours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon lidless orb the very zenith gains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pours a flood of fire o’er all the plains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now were it sweet beneath a beech to slumber!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, like a swarm of hornets without number⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An angry swarm, fierce darting high and low⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or liks the hot sparks from a grindstone, grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pitiless rays; and Love’s poor pilgrim, worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gasping, and by weariness o’erborne,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forth from her bodice draws its golden pin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that her panting bosom shows within.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All dazzling white, like the campanulas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That bloom beside the summer sea, it was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like twin-billows in a brooklet, full.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon, the solitary scene and dull</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Loses a little of its sadness, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lake shows on the limit of the land⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spacious lake, whose wavelets dance and shine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While shrubs of golden-herb and jessamine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the dark shore appear to soar aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they cast a shadow cool and soft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It seems to the poor maid a heavenly vision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A heartening glimpse into the land elysian.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soon, afar, by that blue wave she sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A town with circling walls and palaces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fountains gay, and churches without end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slender spires that to the sun ascend,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ships and lesser sailing-craft, sun-bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entering the port; and the wind seemeth light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the oriflambs and streamers all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Languidly round the masts arise and fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A miracle!” the maiden thought, and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wipes the abundant moisture from her brow,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, with new hope, toward the town doth fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeming the Maries’ tomb is surely there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! alas! he her flight ne’er so speedy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A change will pass upon the scene. Already</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweet illusion seems to fade and flit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recedes the vision as she follows it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An airy show, the substance of a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By spirit woven out of a sunbeam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all its fair hues borrowed from the sky⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The filmy fabric wavers presently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And melts away, and like a mist is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bewildered by the heat, and quite alone,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is left Mirèio: yet her way she keeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiling over the burning, yielding heaps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sand; over the salt-encrusted waste⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seamed, swollen, dazzling to the eye⁠—doth haste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On through the tall marsh-grasses and the reeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rushes, haunted by the gnat, she speeds,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With Vincen ever in her thought. And soon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skirting the lonesome Vacarès lagune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sees it loom at last in distance dim⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sees it grow on the horizon’s rim⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Saints’ white tower, across the billowy plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like vessel homeward bound upon the main.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, even at that blessèd moment, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hot shafts of the unpitying sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ill-starred maiden’s forehead pierced, and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Staggered, death-smitten, by the glassy sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dropped upon the sand. Weep, sons of Crau,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweetest flower in all the land lies low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, in a valley by the river-side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young turtle-doves a huntsman bath espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some innocently drinking, others cooing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, through the copse-wood with his gun pursuing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the most fair takes alway his first aim⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cruel sun had only done the same.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now, as she lay in swoon upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A swarm of busy gnats came hovering o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who seeing the white breast and fluttering breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the poor maiden fainting to her death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ne’er a friendly spray of juniper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all the pulsing fire to shelter her,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each one the viol of his tiny wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imploring played with plaintive murmurings⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Get thee up quickly, quickly, damsel fair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For aye malignant is this burning air,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stung the drooping head; and sea-spray flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprinkling the fevered face with bitter dew:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until at last Mirèio rose again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, with a feeble moan of mortal pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My head! my head!” she dragged her way forlorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slow from salicorne to salicorne⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor little one!⁠—until her heavy feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrived before the seaside Saints’ retreat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There, her sad eyes with tears all brimming o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the cold flags of the chapel-floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wet with the infiltration of the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sank, and clasped her brow in agony;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the pinions of the waiting air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was borne aloft Mirèio’s faltering prayer:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<span>“O holy Maries, who can cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">The sorrow-laden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lend, I beseech, a pitying ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To one poor maiden!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And when you see my cruel care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And misery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then look in mercy down the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And side with me!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I am so young, dear Saints above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And there’s a youth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My handsome Vincen⁠—whom I love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">With utter truth!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I love him as the wayward stream</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Its wanderings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As loves the new-fledged bird, I deem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To try its wings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And now they tell me I must quench</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">This fire eternal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must from the blossoming almond wrench</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Its flowers vernal.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O holy Maries, who can cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">The sorrow-laden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lend, I beseech, a pitying ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To one poor maiden!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now am I come, dear Saints, from far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To sue for peace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor mother-prayer my way could bar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Nor wilderness;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The sun, that cruel archer, shot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Into my brain⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thorns, as it were, and nails red-hot⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Sharp is the pain;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet give me but my Vincen dear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Then will we duly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We two, with glad hearts worship here⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Oh, I say truly!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then the dire pain will rend no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">These brows of mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the face bathed in tears before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Will smile and shine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My sire mislikes our love; is cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And cruel often:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twere naught to you, fair Saints of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">His heart to soften.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Howe’er so hard the olive grow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">’Tis mollified</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By all the winds that alway blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">At Advent-tide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The medlar and the service-plum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">So sharp to taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When gathered, strewn on straw become</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">A pleasant feast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O holy Maries, who can cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">The sorrow-laden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lend, I beseech, a pitying ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To one poor maiden!</span>
				</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					<span>“Oh, what can mean this dazzling light?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">The church is riven</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’erhead; the vault with stars is bright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Can this be heaven?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Oh, who so happy now as I?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">The Saints, my God⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shining Saints⁠—toward me fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Down yon bright road!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O blessed patrons, are you there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">To help, to stay me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet hide the dazzling crowns you wear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Or these will slay me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Veil in a cloud the light appalling!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">My eyes are heavy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is the chapel? Are you calling?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">O Saints, receive me!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<span>So, in a trance and past all earthly feeling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stricken girl upon the pavement kneeling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pleading hands, and head thrown backward, cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her large and lovely eyes were opened wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she beyond the veil of flesh discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span><abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s gates, and for the glory yearned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mute were her lips now; but her face yet shone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrapped in glorious contemplation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She seemed. So, when the gold-red rays of dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Early alight the poplar-tips upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flickering night-lamp turneth pale and wan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dim chamber of a dying man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, as at daybreak, also, flocks arouse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From slumber and disperse, the sacred house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appeared to open, all its vaulted roof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To part, and pillars tall to stand aloof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the three fair women⁠—heavenly fair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who on a starry path came down the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>White in the ether pure, and luminous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came the three Maries out of heaven thus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of them clasped an alabaster vase</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close to her breast, and her celestial face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In splendour had that star alone for peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That beams on shepherds when the nights are clear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The next came with a palm in her hand holden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wind lifting her long hair and golden.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The third was young, and wound a mantle white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About her sweet brown visage; and the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her dark eyes, under their falling lashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was greater than a diamond’s when it flashes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, nearer to the mourner drew these three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leaned above, and spake consolingly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bright and tender were the smiles that wreathed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their lips, and soft the message that they breathed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They made the thorns of cruel martyrdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That pierced Mirèio, into flowers bloom.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>“Be of good cheer, thou poor Mirèio;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we are they men call the Saints of Baux⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Maries of Judaea: and we three⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be of good cheer!⁠—we watch the stormy sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby we succour many a craft distresst;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the wild waves are still at our behest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Look up along <abbr>St.</abbr> James’s path in air!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A moment since we stood together there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the celestial end thereof, remote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, gazing through the clustered stars, took note</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How faithful souls to Campoustello throng</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek the dear Saint’s tomb, and worship long.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, with the tune of falling fountains blending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We heard the solemn litanies ascending</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From pilgrims gathered in the fields at even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pealing of church-bells, and glory given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto our son and nephew, by his names</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Spain’s apostle and the greater James.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then were we glad of all the pious vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paid to his memory; and, on the brows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those poor pilgrims, dews of peace shed we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their souls flooded with serenity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, suddenly, thy warm petition came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seemed to smite us like a jet of flame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear child, thy faith is great; yet thy request</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our pitying hearts right sorely hath opprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou wouldst drink the waters of pure love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ever to its source thee Death remove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bliss we have in God himself to share.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Host thou, then, seen contentment anywhere</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On earth? Is the rich blest, who softly lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his haughty heart his God denies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cares not for his fellow-man at all?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest the leech when it is gorged will fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he before the judgment-seat must pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of One who meekly rode upon an ass.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Is the young mother happy to impart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto her baby, with a swelling heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first warm jet of milk? One bitter drop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingled therewith, may poison all her hope.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now see her lean, distraught, the cradle over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a fair little corse with kisses cover.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And hath she happiness, the promised bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering churchward by her lover’s side?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, no! The path under those lingering feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thornier shall prove, to those who travel it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than sloe-bush of the moorland. Here below</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are only trial sharp and weary woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And here below the purest waters ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are bitter on the lips of the receiver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The worm is born within the fruit alway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all things haste to ruin and decay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The orange thou hast chosen, out of all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The basket’s wealth, shall one day taste as gall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And in thy world, Mirèio, they who seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To breathe, sigh only. And should any dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of drinking at the founts that run not dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anguish alone such bitter draught will buy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So must the stone be broken evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere thou extract the shining silver ore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Happy is he who cares for others’ woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toils for men, and wearies only so;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his own shoulders tears their mantle warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therein to fold some pale and shivering form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is lowly with the lowly, and can waken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire-light on cold hearths of the world-forsaken.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hark to the sovereign word, of man forgot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Death too is Life;’ and happy is the lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the meek soul and simple⁠—he who fares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quietly heavenward, wafted by soft airs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lily-white forsakes this low abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where men have stoned the very saints of God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if, Mirèio, thou couldst see before thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As we from empyrean heights of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This world; and what a sad and foolish thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all its passion for the perishing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its churchyard terrors⁠—then, O lambkin sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mayhap thou wouldst for death and pardon bleat!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, ere the wheat-ear hath its feathery birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ferments the grain within the darksome earth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such ever is the law; and even we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before we wore our crowns of majesty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drank bitter draughts. Therefore, thy soul to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll tell the pains and perils of our way.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Paused for a moment, then, the holy three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves, being fain to listen, coaxingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had flocked along the ocean sand; the pines</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the rustling water-weeds made signs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And teal and gull beheld, with deep amaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace on the restless heart of Vacarès;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun and moon, afar the desert o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bow their great crimson foreheads, and adore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all Camargue⁠—salt-sown, forsaken isle⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seems thrilled with sacred expectation; while</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saints, to hearten for her mortal strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love’s martyr, tell the story of their life.</span>
