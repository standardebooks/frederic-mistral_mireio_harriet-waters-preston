			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Fixing a troubled eye on the old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen to Master Ambroi thus began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while a mighty wind, the poplars bending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its howl unto the poor lad’s voice was lending:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am mad, father, as I oft of late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have said. Thinkest thou I’m jesting when I say’t?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Before his nut-shell cot the Rhône beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat Ambroi on a fallen trunk, and plied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His trade. And, as he peeled the osier withe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen received it, and, with fingers lithe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strong, bent the white rods to basket form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting upon the door-stone. With the storm</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of wind was the Rhône’s bosom agitated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves drove seaward like a herd belated;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But round about the but an azure mere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread tranquilly. The billows brake not here:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pleasant shelter gave the willow-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beavers gnawed their bitter bark in peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While yonder, through the deep of limpid water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darted at intervals the dark brown otter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Following the silver-flashing fish. Among</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The reeds and willows, pendulines had hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their tiny nests, white woven with the wool</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plucked from the poplar when its flowers are full.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And here the small things fluttered full of glee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or swang on wind-rocked stems right lazily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, too, a sprightly lassie, golden-haired⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head like a crown-cake!⁠—back and forward fared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spread on a fig-tree a fishing-net</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwieldy and with water dripping yet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Birds, beavers, otters, feared the maid no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than whispering reeds or willows of the shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was the daughter of the basket-weaver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little Vinceneto. No one ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had even bored her ears, poor child! yet so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes were damson-blue, her bosom low⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A caper-blossom by the river-side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wooed by the splashing of the amorous tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now old Ambroi, with his long white beard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowing o’er all his breast, his head upreared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered Vincen’s outcry: “What is’t? Mad?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You are a blockhead! that is all, my lad!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah!” said the other, “for the ass to stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet must the mead be. But what do I say?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest her! If she to Arles should fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All other maids would hide them in despair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, after her, I think the mould was broken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what say to the words herself hath spoken,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘You I will have!’ ”⁠—“Why, naught, poor fool! say I:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let poverty and riches make reply!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O father!” Vincen cried, “go, I implore thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Lotus Farm, and tell them all the story!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell them to look for virtue, not for gain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell them that I can plough a stony plain,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or harrow, or prune vines with any man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell them their six yoke, with my guiding, can</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plough double! Tell them I revere the old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, if they part us for the sake of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We shall both die, and they may bury us!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh, fie! But you are young who maunder thus,”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth Master Ambroi. “All this talk I know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The white hen’s egg, the chaffinch on the bough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ll have the pretty bird this very minute!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whistle, bring sugared cake, or die to win it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet will the chaffinch never come, be sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And perch upon your finger! You are poor!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Plague on my poverty!” poor Vincen cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tearing his hair. “Is God who hath denied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that could make life worthy⁠—is He just?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wherefore are we poor? And wherefore must</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We still the refuse of the vineyard gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While others pluck the purple clusters rather?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lifting his hands, the old man sternly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Weave on, and drive this folly from your head!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall the corn-ears rebuke the reaper, pray?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or silly worm to God the Father say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Why am I not a star in heaven to shine?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or shall the ox to be a drover pine,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So to eat corn instead of straw? Nay, nay!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through good and ill we all must hold our way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hand’s five fingers were unequal made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be you a lizard, as your Master bade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dwell content upon your wall apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drink your sunbeam with a thankful heart!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I tell thee, father, I this maid adore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than my sister, than my Maker more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I have her not, ’tis death, I say!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then to the rough stream Vincen fled away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While little Vinceneto burst out weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let fall her net, and near the weaver creeping⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O father! ere thou drive my brother wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listen to me!” began the eager child:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For where I served the master had a daughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had a labourer, too, who loved and sought her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as our Vincen loves Mirèio.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was named Alis; he, Sivèstre: and so</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He laboured like a wolf because he loved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skilful and prompt, quiet and saving proved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took such care, master slept tranquilly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But once⁠—mark, father, how perverse men be!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One morning master’s wife, as it befell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’erheard Sivèstre his love to Alis tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So when at dinner all the men were sitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The master gave Sivèstre a wrathful greeting.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Traitor!’ he cried, with his eyes all aglow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘You are discovered! Take your wage, and go!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We looked at one another in dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the good servant rose, and went his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thereafter, for three weeks, when we were working,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We used to see him round the farmstead lurking⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sorry sight; for all his clothes were torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his face very pale and wild and worn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft at eve he to the trellis came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called the little mistress by her name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Erelong the hay-rick at its corners four</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burnt all a-flame. And, father, something more!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They drew a drownèd man out of the well.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Ambroi, in gruff tones half-audible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A little child a little trouble gives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And more and more for every year he lives.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therewith put his long spatterdashes on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which he himself had made in days bygone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hobnailed shoes, and long red cap, and so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway set forth upon the road to Crau.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas harvest-time, the eve of <abbr>St.</abbr> John’s day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hedgerow paths were crowded all the way</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With troops of dusty, sunburnt mountaineers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hired for the reaping of the golden ears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fig-wood quivers were their sickles borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slung to a belt across the shoulder worn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By twos and twos they came, and every pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had its own sheaf-binder. And carts were there,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bearing the weary elders, and beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pipes and tambourines with ribbons tied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon by fields of beardless wheat they passed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lashed into billows by the noisy blast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “<i xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu</i>, but that is noble grain!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They cried. “What tufts of ears! There shall we gain</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Right pleasant reaping! The wind bows them over;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But see you not how quickly they recover?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all the wheat-crop of Provence thus cheering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grandfather?” asked a youth, old Ambroi nearing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The red is backward still,” he made reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But, if this windy weather last, deem I</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sickles will fail us ere the work be done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How like three stars the Christmas candles shone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was a blessed sign of a good year!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now, grandfather, may the good God thee hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in thy granary the same fulfil!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Ambroi and the reapers chatted still</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In friendly wise, under the willows wending;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these as well to Lotus Farm were tending.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It also chanced that Master Ramoun went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That eve to hearken for the wheat’s complaint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the wind, wild waster of the grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as he strode over the yellow plain</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From north to south, he heard the golden corn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Murmuring, “See the ills that we have borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master, from this great gale. It spills our seed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blurs our bloom!”⁠—“Put on your gloves of reed,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang others, “else the ants will be more fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rob us of our all but hardened wheat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When will the sickles come?” And Ramoun turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the trees, and even then discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The reapers rising in the distance dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, as they nearer drew, saluted him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With waving sickles flashing in the sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then roared the master, “Welcome, every one!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A very God-send!” cried he, loud and long;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soon the sheaf-binders about him throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “Shake hands! Why, Holy Cross, look here!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What heaps of sheaves, good master, will this year</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cumber your treading-floor!”⁠—“Mayhap,” said he:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We cannot alway judge by what we see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Till all is trod, the truth will not be known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have known years that promised,” he went on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Eighty full bushels to the acre fairly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yielded in their stead a dozen barely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet let us be content!” And, with a smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shook their hands all round in friendly style,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And gossiped with old Ambroi affably.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So entered all the homestead path, and he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called out once more, “Come forth, Mirèio mine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prepare the chiccory and draw the wine!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she right lavishly the table spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Ramoun first him seated at its head,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the rest in their order, for the lunch.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forthwith the labourers began to crunch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard-crusted bread their sturdy teeth between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hail the salad made of goats-beard green;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While fair as an oat-leaf the table shone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in superb profusion heaped thereon</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Were odorous cheese, onions and garlic hot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grilled egg-plant, fiery peppers, and what not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sting the palate. Master Ramoun poured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wine, king in the field and at the board;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raising his mighty flagon now and then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And calling for a bumper on the men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To keep the sickles keen on stony ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They must be often whetted, I have found.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The reapers held their goblets, bidden so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And red and clear the wine began to flow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, whet the blades!” the cheery master cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And furthermore gives order in this wise:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now eat your fill, and all your strength restore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But go thereafter, as you used of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And branches in the copse-wood cut, and bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fagots; thus a great heap gathering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when ’tis night, my lads, we’ll do the rest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this the fête is of Saint John the blest⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Saint John the reaper, and the friend of God.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So spake the lord of all these acres broad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The high and noble art of husbandry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rule of men, none better knew than he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how to make a golden harvest grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From dark sods moistened by the toiler’s brow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A grave and simple master of the soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose frame was bending now with years and toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet oft, of old, when floors were full of wheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glowing with pride he had performed the feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his youthful corps, upright to stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing two pecks upon each horny hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He could the influence of the moon rehearse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell when her look is friendly, when adverse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she will raise the sap, and when depress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coming weather from her halo guess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from her silver-pale or fiery face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear signs to him were birds and keen March days,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And mouldy bread and noisome August fogs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span><abbr>St.</abbr> Clara’s dawn, the rainbow-hued sun-dogs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wet seasons, times of drought and frost and plenty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full oft, in pleasant years, a-ploughing went he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With six fair, handsome beasts. And, verily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself have seen, and it was good to see,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The soil part silently before the share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And its dark bosom to the sun lay bare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The comely mules, ne’er from the furrow breaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiled on as though they care and thought were taking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what they did. With muzzles low they went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And arching necks like bows when these are bent,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And hasted not, nor lagged. Followed along⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eye on the mules, and on his lips a song⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ploughman, with one handle only guiding.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, in the realm where we have seen presiding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our old friend Ramoun, flourished every thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he bare sceptre like a very king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now says he grace, and lifts his eyes above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And signs the holy cross. The labourers move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away to make the bonfire ready. These</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring kindling; those, the boughs of dark pine-trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the old men alone at table staying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A silence fell. But Ambroi brake it, saying⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For counsel, Ramoun, am I come to thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I am in a great perplexity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou only canst resolve. Cure see I none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest, Master, that I have a son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who has been passing good until this day⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It were ingratitude aught else to say;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But there are flaws even in precious stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tender lambs will have convulsions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the still waters are perfidious ever:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So my mad boy⁠—thou wilt believe it never⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loves the daughter of a rich freeholder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swears he will in his embrace enfold her!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay, swears he will, the maniac! And his love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his despair my soul to terror move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I showed him all his folly, be thou sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how wealth gains, and poverty grows poor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this hard world. In vain! He would but call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Cost what it may, tell thou her parents all⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Tell them to look for virtue, not for gain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell them that I can plough a stony plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or harrow, or prune vines with any man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell them their six yoke, with my guiding, can</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plough double! Tell them I revere the old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, if they part us for the sake of gold,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘We shall both die, and need but burial.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, Master Ramoun, I have told thee all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I, clad in my rags, for this maid sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or leave my son to die of sorrow?”⁠—“Whew!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other. “To such wind spread thou no sail!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor he, nor she, will perish of this ail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So much, good friend, I say in utmost faith.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor would I, Ambroi, fret myself to death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I were thou; but, seeing him so mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would say plainly, ‘Calm your mind, my lad!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if you raise a tempest by your passions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll teach you with a cudgel better fashions!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If an ass, Ambroi, for more fodder bray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throw him none down, but let thy bludgeon play.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Provençal families in days bygone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were healthy, brave, and evermore at one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strong as plane-trees when a storm befell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They had their strifes, indeed⁠—we know it well;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, when returned the holy Christmas eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grandsire all his children would receive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At his own board, under a star-sown tent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ceased the voice of strife and all dissent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, lifting hands that wrinkled were and trembled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He blessed the generations there assembled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Moreover, he who is a father truly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will have his child yield him obedience duly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flock that drives the shepherd, soon or late,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will meet a wolf and a disastrous fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When we were young, had any son withstood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His father, he, belike, had shed his blood!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou wilt kill me then, father! It is I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Vincen worships thus despairingly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And before God and our most holy Mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I give my soul to him, and to no other!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A deathlike hush followed Mirèio’s word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wife of Ramoun was the first who stirred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upspringing with clasped hands and utterance wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your speech is an atrocious insult, child!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your love’s a thorn that long hath stung us deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alari, the owner of a thousand sheep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You sent away; and keeper Veran too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disgusted with your scorn, his suit withdrew;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Also the wealthy herdsman, Ourrias,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You treated as a dog and a scapegrace!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tramp through the country with your beggar, then!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herd with strange women and with outcast men!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cook your pot with fortune-telling crones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a bridge mayhap, upon three stones.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Go, gypsy, you are free!” the mother said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor stayed Ramoun her pitiless tirade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though his eye like a taper burned. But now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lightning flashed under his shaggy brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his wrath brake, all barriers overbearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like swollen torrent down a mountain tearing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Your mother’s right!” he said. “Go! travel yonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take the tempest with you where you wander!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, but you shall not! Here you shall remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I should bind you with an iron chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hold like a rebellious jumart, look!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dragged by the nostrils with an iron hook!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea, though you pine with sickly melancholy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till from your cheeks the roses perish wholly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fade as snow fades when the sun is hot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the hill-sides in spring, go shall you not!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mark, Mirèio! Sure as the hearth’s ashes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest on that brick, and sure as the Rhône dashes</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Above its banks when it is overfull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sure as that’s a lamp, and here I rule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ll see him never more!” The table leapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath his fist. Mirèio only wept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her heavy tears like dew on smallage rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or grapes o’er ripe before a hurricane.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And who,” resumed the old man, blind with rage⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Curse it!⁠—I say, who, Ambroi, will engage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst not with the younger ruffian plot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This vile abduction, yonder in thy cot?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Ambroi also sprang infuriate⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good God!” he cried, “we are of low estate;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But let me tell you that our hearts are high!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No shame, no stain, is honest poverty!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ve served my country forty years or more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On shipboard, and I know the cannon’s roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So young that I could scarce a boat-hook swing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When on my first cruise I went wandering.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I’ve seen Melinda’s empire far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with Suffren have haunted India,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And done my duty over all the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great wars, where’er our flag unfurled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That southern chief who passed his conquering hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one red sweep from Spain to Russian land,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And at whose drum-beat every clime was quaking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like aspen-tree before the tempest shaking;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horrors of boarding, shipwreck’s agonies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These have I known, and darker things than these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Days than the sea more bitter. Being poor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No bit of motherland might I secure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Scorned of the rich, I might not dress the sward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But suffer forty years without reward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We ate dog’s food, on the hoar-frost we lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weary of life, we rushed into the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so upbore the glorious name of France.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But no one holds it in remembrance!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His caddis-cloak upon the ground he threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spake no more. “What great thing wilt thou do?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked Ramoun, and his tone was full of scorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I, too, have heard the cannon-thunder borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the valley of Toulon, have seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bridge of Arcole stormed, and I have been</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In Egypt when her sands were red with gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we, like men, when those great wars were o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Returning, fiercely fell upon the soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dried our very marrow up with toil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day began long ere the eastern glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rising moon surprised us at the hoe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They say the Earth is generous. It is true!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, like a nut-tree, naught she gives to you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless well-beaten. And if all were known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each clod of landed ease thus hardly won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He who should number them would also know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweat-drops that have fallen from my brow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And must I, by Ste. Anne of Apt, be still?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like satyr toil, of siftings eat my fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the homestead may grow wealthy, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself before the world with honour stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet go and give my daughter to a tramp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A vagabond, a straw-loft-sleeping scamp?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“God’s thunder strike you and your dog! Begone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I,” the master said, “will keep my swan.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These were his last rough words; and steadily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambroi arose, and his cloak lifted he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only rested on his staff to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Adieu! Mayst thou not regret this day!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And may the good God and his angels guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The orange-laden bark across the tide!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, as he passed into the falling night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the branch-heap arose a ruddy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one long tongue of flame the wanderer sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Curled like a horn by the careering breeze;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And round it reapers dancing blithesomely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pulsing feet, and haughty heads and free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrown back, and faces by the bonfire lit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loud crackling as the night-wind fanneth it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sound of coals that to the brazier fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blends with the fife-notes fine but musical,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And merry as the song of the hedge-sparrow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, but it thrills the old Earth to her marrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou dost visit her, beloved <abbr>St.</abbr> John!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sparks went whirling upward, and hummed on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tabor gravely and incessantly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the low surging of a tranquil sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did the dusky troop their sickle wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And three great leaps athwart the flame they gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cloves of odorous garlic from a string</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the glowing embers they did fling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And holy herb and John’s-wort bare anigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these were purified and blessed thereby.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then “Hail, <abbr>St.</abbr> John!” thrice rose a deafening shout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hills and plain, illumined round about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparkled as though the dark were showering stars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sure the Saint, above the heaven’s blue bars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The breath of all this incense doth inhale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wafted aloft by the unconscious gale.</span>
