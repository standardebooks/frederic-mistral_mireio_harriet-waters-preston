			<p>
				<span>The merry birds, until the white dawn showeth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear in the east, are silent every one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silent the odorous Earth until she knoweth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her warm heart the coming of the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As maiden in her fairest robes bedight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathless awaits her lover and her flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Across La Crau three swineherds held their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From <abbr>St.</abbr> Chamas the wealthy, whither they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had to the market gone. Their herds were sold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er their shoulders pouches full of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were hung, and by their hanging cloaks concealed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, chatting idly, they attained the field</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of the late strife. Suddenly one cried, “Hush!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comrades, I hear a moaning in the bush.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis but a tolling bell,” the rest averred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From Saint Martin’s or from Maussano<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-59" id="noteref-59" epub:type="noteref">59</a> heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the north wind the dwarf-oak limbs a-swaying.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, ere they spake, all were their steps delaying,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Arrested by so piteous a groan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It rent the very heart. And every one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried, “Holy Jesus! Here has been foul play!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then crossed themselves, and gently took their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the sound. Ah, what a sight there was!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen, supine upon the stony grass⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The grass blood-stained, the trampled earth besprent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With willow rods. His shirt to ribbons rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stabbed in the breast, left on the moor alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had lain the poor lad through the night now gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With but the stars to watch. But the dim ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of early dawn, as ebbed his life away,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Falling upon his lids had oped them wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway the good Samaritans turned aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their home-path, stooped, and a hammock made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their three cloaks, thereon the victim laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then bare him tenderly upon their arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the nearest door⁠—the Lotus-Farm’s.⁠ ⁠…</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O friends⁠—Provençal poets brave and dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love my songs of other days to hear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You, Roumanille, who blend with songs you sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears, girlish laughter, and the breath of spring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you, proud Aubanel, who stray where quiver</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The changing lights and shades of wood and river,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To soothe a heart oppressed by love’s fond dream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You, Crousillat, who your belovèd stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bright Touloubro, make more truly famous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than did the grim star-gazer Nostradamus;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-60" id="noteref-60" epub:type="noteref">60</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you, Anselme, who see, half-sad, half-smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair girls under the trellised arbours whiling</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their hours away; and you, my Paul, the witty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peasant Tavan, who attune your ditty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the crickets’ chirrup, while you peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wistful at your poor pickaxe; and most dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adolphe Dumas, who when Durance is deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his spring flood, come back your thoughts to steep,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And warm the Frenchman at Provençal suns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas you who met my own Mirèio once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At your great Paris⁠—met her tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where she had flown, impetuous, daring, shy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And last Garcin, brave son of a brave sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose soul mounts upward on a wind of fire;⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upbear me with your holy breath as now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I climb for the fair fruit on that high bough!⁠ ⁠…</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The swineherds paused at Master Ramoun’s door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying, “Good-morrow! Yonder, on the moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We found this poor lad wounded in the breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twere well that his sore hurt were quickly drest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So laid their burden on the broad, flat stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell Mirèio, to the garden gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gather fruit, who, basket on her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled wildly to the spot. Thither, too, hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The labourers all; but she, her basket falling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretched forth her hands on Mother Mary calling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Vincen is bleeding! Ah, what have they done?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, lovingly, the head of the dear one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She lifted, turned, and long and mutely gazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though with horror and with grief amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her large tears dropping fast. And well he knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That tender touch to be Mirèio’s,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And faintly breathes, “Pity, and pray for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I need the good God’s company!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your parched throat moisten with this cordial.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-61" id="noteref-61" epub:type="noteref">61</a> Strive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drink,” old Ramoun said: “you will revive.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden seized the cup, and drop by drop</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She made him drink, and spake to him of hope</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till his pain lulled. “May God keep you alway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From such distress, and your sweet care repay!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Vincen; and the brave boy would not tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was for her sake that he fought and fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But “Splitting osier on my breast,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The sharp knife slipped, and pierced me.” Therewith strayed</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His thought back to his love as bee to flower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The anguish on thy face, dear, in this hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is far more bitter than my wound to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pretty basket that in company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We once began will be unfinished now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would I had seen it full to overflow,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear, with thy love! Oh, stay! Life’s in thine eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, if thou couldst do something,” the lad cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For him⁠—the poor old basket-weaver there⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father, worn with toil!” In her despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio bathes the wound, while some bring lint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some run to the hills for healing mint.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the maid’s mother spake: “Let four men rally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the Fairies’ Cavern,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-62" id="noteref-62" epub:type="noteref">62</a> in the valley</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They call Enfer, bear up this wounded man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deadlier the hurt, the sooner can</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old witch heal. Scale first the cliffs of Baux,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And circling vultures the cave’s mouth will show.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A hole flush with the rocks, by lizards haunted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And veiled by tufts of rosemary thereby planted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ever, since the holy Angelus swells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Mary’s honour from the minster-bells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The antique fairies have been forced to hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From sunlight, and in this deep cavern bide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strange, airy things, they used to flit about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dimly, ’twixt form and substance, in and out:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-earthly made, to be the visible</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spirit of Nature; female made as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tame the savagery of primal men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But these were fair in fairies’ eyes, and then</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They loved: and so, infatuate, lifted not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mortals unto their own celestial lot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, lusting, fell into our low estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As birds fall, whom a snake doth fascinate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their high places. But, while thus I write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bearers have borne Vincen up the height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A dim, straight passage led the cavern toward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rocky funnel where they gently lowered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sufferer; and he did not go alone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet was Mirèio’s self the only one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dared to follow down that awesome road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commending, as she went, his soul to God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bottom gained, they found a grotto cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vast; midway whereof a beldam old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The witch Taven, sat silent, crouching lowly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As lost in thought and utter melancholy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holding a sprig of brome, and muttering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Some call thee devil’s wheat, poor little thing,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet art thou one of God’s own signs for good!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therewith Mirèio, trembling where she stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was fain to tell why they had sought her thus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I knew it!” cried the witch, impervious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brome addressing still, with bended head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou poor field-flower! The trampling flock,” she said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Browse on thy leaves and stems the whole year long;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all the more thou spreadest and art strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And north and south with verdure deckest yet.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She ceased. A dim light, in a snail-shell set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced o’er the dank rock-wall in lurid search:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here hung a sieve; there, on a forkèd perch,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roosted a raven, a white hen beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly, as if drunken, rose and cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The witch, “And what care I whoe’er you be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith walketh blindfold, so doth Charity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor from her even tenor wandereth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say, Valabregan weaver, have you faith?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I have.” Then wildly, their pursuit inviting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a she-wolf her flanks with her tail smiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darted the hag into a deeper shaft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the fowl cackled and the raven laughed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her footsteps; and the boy and maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed her through the darkness, sore afraid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Stay not!” she cried. “The time is now to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mystic mandrake.” And, with hands entwined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obedient to the voice the two crept on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the infernal passage, till they won</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A grotto larger than the rest. “Lo! now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lord Nostradamus’ plant, the golden bough,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The staff of Joseph and the rod of Moses!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus crying, Taven a slender shrub discloses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, kneeling, with her chaplet crowns. Then said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arising, “We too must be garlanded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With mandrake;” and the plant in the rock’s cleft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of three fair sprays mysteriously bereft,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Herself crowned first, and next the wounded man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And last the maid. Then, crying, “Forward!” ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the weird way, before her footsteps lit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By shining beetles trooping over it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet turned with a sage word⁠—“All paths of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My children, have their space of purgatory!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Therefore have courage! for we must, alas!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The terrors of the Sabatori<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-63" id="noteref-63" epub:type="noteref">63</a> pass.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, while she spake, their faces cut they find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breathing stopped, by rush of keenest wind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lie down!” she whispered hurriedly⁠—“lie low!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The triumph of the Whirlwind Sprites is now!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fell upon them, like a sudden gale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or white squall on the water fraught with hail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A swarm of whirling, yelping, vicious things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the fanning of whose icy wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mortals, drenched with sweat and struck with cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood shivering. “Away, ye over-bold,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye spoilers of the harvest, unlicked whelps!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taven exclaimed. “Must we then use such helps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fair deeds we do? Yet, as by skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sage physician bringeth good from ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We witches, by our hidden arts, compel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil to yield its fruit of good as well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Naught’s hid from us. For where the vulgar see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stone, a whip, a stag, a malady,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We witches can the inner force divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like that which works under the scum of wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fermentation. Pierce the vat, you know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A seething, boiling scum will outward flow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Find, if you can, the key of Solomon!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or speak unto the mountain in its own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dread language! It shall move at your behest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And roll into the valley ere it rest.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile they wended lower, and were ’ware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a small, roguish voice a-piping there,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Most like a goldfinch: “Our good granny spins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winds and spins, and then anew begins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thinks that she spins worsted night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ha! ha! gossip, she spins only hay!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Te! he! spin, Aunty, spin!” And long-drawn laughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like whinnying of young colts, followed thereafter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why, what can that be?” asked Mirèio⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The little voice that laughs and jeers us so?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again the childish treble came, “Te! he!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who is this pretty mortal? Let us see!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll raise the neckerchief a little bit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are nuts and pomegranates under it?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the poor maid had nearly cried outright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the hag stayed her, “Here’s no cause for fright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The singing, jeering thing is but a Glari:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fantasti is his name, a sprightly fairy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his good mood he will your kitchen sweep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mind fire, turn roast, and a full hen’s-nest keep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But what a marplot when he takes the whim!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’ll salt your broth just as it pleaseth him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or blow your light out ere you’re half in bed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, if to vespers you would go,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“At Saint Trophime,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-64" id="noteref-64" epub:type="noteref">64</a> in all your best bedight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’ll hide your Sunday suit, or spoil it quite!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hear!” shrieked the imp: “now hear the old hag talk!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis like the creak of an ill-greasèd block!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No doubt, my withered olive,” the thing said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I twitch the bedclothes off a sleeping maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sometimes at midnight, and she starts with fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trembles, and her breast heaves. Oh, I see her!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with its whinnying laugh the sprite was gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, for a brief space, as they journeyed on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the grots, the witcheries were stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the gloomy silence, long delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They heard the water drop from vaulted roof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crystal ground. Now there had sat aloof,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon a ledge of rock, a tall, white thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which rose in the half-light as menacing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one long arm. Then stiff as a quartz rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood Vincen; while, transported by the shock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio would have leaped a precipice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had such been there. “Old scare-crow, what is this?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What mean you,” cried Taven, “by swaying so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your limp head like a poplar to and fro?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then turning to the stricken twain, “My dears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You know the Laundress? Oft-times she appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Mount Ventour, and then the common crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are wont to take her for a long, white cloud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But shepherds, when they see her, pen their sheep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Laundress of destruction, who doth keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The errant clouds in hand, is known too well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She scrubs them with a strength right terrible;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wringing out buckets full of rain, and flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And neatherds house their cattle at her name;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And seamen, on the angry, tossing wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon our Lady call, their craft to save.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here drowned her speech a discord most appalling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rattling of latches, whimpering, caterwauling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With uncouth words half-uttered intervening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof the devil only knows the meaning;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And brazen din through all the cave resounding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one were on a witch-cauldron pounding.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then whence those shrieks of laughter, and those wails</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a woman in her pains? Prevails</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hardly amid the howl the beldam’s speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Give me a hand that I may hold you each,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And let your magic garlands not be lost!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here were they jostled from their feet almost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By rush of something puffing, grunting, snorting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most like a herd of ghostly swine comporting.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On starlit winter-nights, when Nature slumbers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under her snowy sheets, come forth in numbers</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fowlers, torch in hand, who bush and tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By river-side will beat right vigorously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the birds at roost arise in haste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as by breath of smithy-bellows chased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Affrighted, rush until the net receive:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So drave Taven the foul herd with her sieve</span>

			<p>
				<span>Into the outer darkness. With the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She circles traced, luminous, red as flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And divers other figures. All the while,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Avaunt!” she cried, “ye locusts, ye who spoil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The harvest! Quit my sight, or woe betide you!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Workers of evil, in your burrows hide you!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Since, by the pricking of your flesh, ye know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hills are still with sunshine all aglow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go hang yourselves again on the rock-angles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye bats!” They flit. The clamour disentangles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dies away. Then to the children spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The witch: “All birds of night themselves betake</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To this retreat what time shines the daylight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ploughed land and fallow; but at night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At night the lamps are lighted without hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In churches void and triply fastened, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bells toll of themselves, and pavement stones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upstart, and tremble all the buried bones,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And the poor dead arise and kneel to pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mass is said by priests as pale as they.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the owls else, who clamber down the steeple</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drain the lamps of oil; and if the people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who thus partake of the communion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be not all dead except the priests alone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What time the beldam jeers at February,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-65" id="noteref-65" epub:type="noteref">65</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let women everywhere be wondrous wary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor fall asleep on chairs for awful reason!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shepherds as well, at yon uncanny season</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Early your charges fold, and it mislike you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spell should motionless and rigid strike you</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For seven years’ time. The Fairies’ Cavern, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looses about these days its eerie crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winged or four-footed, they o’er Crau disperse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, from their lairs aroused, the sorcerers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gather, the <i xml:lang="oc">farandoulo</i> dance, and sup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An evil potion from a golden cup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The dwarf-oaks dance as well. Lord, how they trip it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile there’s Garamaude in wait for Gripet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fie, cruel flirt! Ay, seize the carrion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And claw her bowels out! Now they are gone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, but they come again! And, oh, despair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monster stealing through the sea-kale there,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The one who like a burglar crouched and ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is Bambarouche, babe-stealing harridan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her wailing prey in her long claw she takes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts on her horny head, and off she makes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yon’s another! She’s the Nightmare-sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes down the chimney-flue at dead of night,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And stealthy climbs upon the sleeper’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, as with weight of a tall tower opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath horrid dreams. Hi! What a hideous racket!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My dears, ’tis the foul-weather fiends who make it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sound of rusty hinges, groaning doors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is they who beat up fog upon the moors,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And ride the winds that homestead-roofs uptear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bear afar. Ha, Moon! What ails you there?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What dire indignity hath made you scowl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So red and large o’er Baux? ’Ware the dog’s howl!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon dog can snap you like a cake, be sure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He minds the filthy Demon of the Sewer!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now see the holm-oaks bend their heads like ferns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see that flame that leaps and writhes and burns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is <abbr>St.</abbr> Elmo’s. And that ringing sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of rapid hoofs upon the stony ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the wild huntsman riding over Crau.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here hoarse and breathless paused the witch of Baux.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But straight thereafter, “Cover ears and eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the black lamb is bleating!” wildly cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That baaing lambkin!” Vincen dared to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she, “Hide eyes and ears without delay!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe to the stumbler here! Sambuco’s Path</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less peril than the black horn’s passage hath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tender his bleating, as you hear, and soft:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereby he lures to their destruction oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heedless Christians who attend his moan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To them he shows the sheen of Herod’s throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gold of Judas, and the fatal spot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Saracens made fast the golden goat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her they may milk till death, to hearts’ content.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, when they call for their last sacrament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The black lamb only buts them savagely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, so evil is the time,” quoth she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Unnumbered greedy souls that bait will seize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burn incense unto gold, then die as these!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now, while the white hen gave three piercing crows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eerie guide did to her guests disclose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thirteenth grotto, and the last; and lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A huge, wide chimney and a hearth aglow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seven black tom-cats warming round the flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, hanging from a hook above the same,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An iron cauldron of gigantic size,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And underneath two fire-brands, dragon-wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belching blue flame. “Is it with these you brew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grandmother,” asked the lad, “your magic stew?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“With these, my son. They’re branches of wild vine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No better logs for burning be than mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well, call them branches if it be your taste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But⁠—but I may not jest. Haste, mother, haste!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, midway of the grotto, they descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A large, round table of red porphyry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, radiating from this wondrous place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lower than root of oak or mountain base,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Infinite aisles whose gleaming columns cluster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like pendant icicles in shape and lustre.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These are the far-famed galleries of the fays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here evermore a hazy brightness plays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Temples and shining palaces are here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Majestic porticoes their fronts uprear,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And many a labyrinth and peristyle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The like whereof was never seen erewhile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even in Corinth or in Babylon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet let a fairy breathe, and these are gone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here, like flickering rays of light, disperse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through he dim walks of this serene Chartreuse,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fairies with their knights long since enchanted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace to the aisles by their fair presence haunted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the witch was ready. First of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She lifted high her hands, then let them fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Vincen had like holy Lawrence lain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the porphyry table, mute with pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And mightily the spirit of the crone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appeared to work within her; and as grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She seemed, when, rising to her height anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She plunged her ladle in the boiling stew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That overflowed the cauldron in the heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all the cats arose and ringed her feet,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, with her left hand, unto Vincen’s breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Applied the scalding drops with solemn zest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazing intently on him where he lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the cruel hurt was charmed away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the while, “The Lord is born, is dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is risen, shall rise again,” she murmurèd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Last on the quivering flesh the cross she made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice with her toe-nail; as in forest glade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tigress fiercely claws her fallen prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now her speech maketh tumultuous way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where the dim gates of the future are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, he shall rise! I see him now afar</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Amid the stones and thistles of the hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His forehead bleeding heavily. And still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the stones and briers he makes his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bowed by his cross. Where is Veronica</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wipe the blood? And him of Cyrene</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stay him when he fainteth⁠—where is he?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And where the weeping Maries, hair dishevelled?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All gone! And rich and poor, before him levelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaze while he mounts; and ‘Who is this,’ one saith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who climbs with shouldered beam, and never stayeth?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O carnal sons of men! The Cross-bearer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is unto you but as a beaten cur.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O cruel Jews! Wherefore so fiercely bite you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hands that feed, and lick the hands that smite you?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Receive the fruit of your foul deeds you must.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your precious gems shall crumble into dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that you deemed fair pulse or wholesome wheat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall turn to ashes even while you eat,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And scare your very hunger. Woe is me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rivers that foam o’er carrion-heaps I see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swords and lances in tumultuous motion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace to thy stormy waves, thou vexèd Ocean!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall Peter’s ancient bark withstand the shock?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas, it strikes upon the senseless rock!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, but there cometh One with power to save!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fisher of men, he quells the rebel wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fair new bark the Rhône is entering now:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She hath God’s cross uplifted on her prow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rainbow divine! Eternal clemency!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another land, another sun, I see!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dance olive-pickers, where the fruit is shining;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink reapers, on the barley-sheaves reclining!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Revealed by signs so many, God,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is in his holy temple worshippèd.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, stretching forth her hand, the witch of Baux</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pointed the way and bade the children go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Light gleamed afar. They haste the ray to follow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They thread their way to the Cordovan Hollow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where sun and air await them, and they seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see Mont Majour’s wrecks, as in a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strewn o’er the hill; yet on the sunlit verge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pause for one kiss or ever they emerge.</span>
