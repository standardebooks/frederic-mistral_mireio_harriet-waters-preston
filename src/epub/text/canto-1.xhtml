			<p>
				<span>I sing the love of a Provençal maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How through the wheat-fields of La Crau<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> she strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Following the fate that drew her to the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unknown beyond remote La Crau was she;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, who tell the rustic tale of her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would fain be Homer’s humble follower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What though youth’s aureóle was her only crown?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never gold she wore nor damask gown?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll build her up a throne out of my song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hail her queen in our despisèd tongue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine be the simple speech that ye all know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shepherds and farmer-folk of lone La Crau.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God of my country, who didst have Thy birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among poor shepherds when Thou wast on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathe fire into my song! Thou knowest, my God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, when the lusty summer is abroad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And figs turn ripe in sun and dew, comes he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brute, greedy man⁠—and quite despoils the tree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet on that ravaged tree thou savest oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some little branch inviolate aloft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tender and airy up against the blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which the rude spoiler cannot win unto:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only the birds shall come and banquet there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, at <abbr>St.</abbr> Magdalene’s, the fruit is fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Methinks I see yon airy little bough:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It mocks me with its freshness even now;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The light breeze lifts it, and it waves on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fruitage and foliage that cannot die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help me, dear God, on our Provençal speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To soar until the birds’ own home I reach!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once, then, beside the poplar-bordered Rhône,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There lived a basket-weaver and his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a poor hut set round with willow-trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For all their humble wares were made from these);</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sometimes they from farm to farm would wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And horses’ cribs and broken baskets mend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so one evening, as they trudged their round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With osier bundles on their shoulders bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Father,” young Vincen said, “the clouds look wild</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About old Magalouno’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> tower up-piled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If that gray rampart fell, ’twould do us harm:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We should be drenched ere we had gained the farm.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, nay!” the old man said, “no rain to-night!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis the sea-breeze that shakes the trees. All right!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A western gale were different.” Vincen mused:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are many ploughs at Lotus farmstead used?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Six ploughs!” the basket-weaver answered slow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It is the finest freehold in La Crau.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Look! There’s their olive-orchard, intermixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rows of vines and almond-trees betwixt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beauty of it is, that vineyard hath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every day in all the year a path!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s ne’er another such the beauty is;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in each path are just so many trees.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O heavens! How many hands at harvest-tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many trees must need!” young Vincen cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay: for ’tis almost Hallowmas, you know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all the girls come flocking in from Baux,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, singing, heap with olives green and dun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sheets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> and sacks, and call it only fun.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sun was sinking, as old Ambroi said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On high were little clouds a-flush with red;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sideways upon their yokèd cattle rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The labourers slowly home, each with his goad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Erect. Night darkened on the distant moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas supper-time, the day of toil was o’er.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And here we are!” the boy cried. “I can see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The straw-heaped threshing-floor, so hasten we!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But stay!” the other. “Now, as I’m alive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lotus Farm’s the place for sheep to thrive⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pine-woods all the summer, and the sweep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great plain in winter. Lucky sheep!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And look at the great trees that shade the dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look at that delicious stream forth welling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inside the vivary! And mark the bees!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Autumn makes havoc in their colonies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But every year, when comes the bright May weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon lotus-grove a hundred swarms will gather.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And one thing more!” cried Vincen, eagerly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The very best of all, it seems to me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean the maiden, father, who dwells here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst not have forgotten how, last year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bade us bring her olive-baskets two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fit her little one with handles new.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, they drew the farm-house door a-nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in the dewy twilight, saw thereby</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maid herself. Distaff in hand she stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watching her silk-worms at their leafy food.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then master Ambroi let his osiers fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sang out cheerily, “Good-even, all!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Father, the same to you!” the damsel said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I had come out my distaff-point to thread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It grows so dark. Whence come you now, I pray?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Valabrègo?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> Ambroi answered, “Yea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I said, when the fast-coming dark I saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘We’ll sleep at Lotus Farm upon the straw.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereat, with no more words, father and son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard by upon a roller sat them down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fell to their own work right busily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A half-made cradle chanced the same to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fast through the nimble fingers of the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The supple osier bent and crossed and flew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Certes, our Vincen was a comely lad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bright face and a manly form he had,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit that summer he was bare sixteen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swart were his cheeks; but the dark soil, I ween,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bears the fine wheat, and black grapes make the wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sets our feet a-dance, our eyes a-shine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full well he knew the osier to prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deftly wrought: but ofttimes to his share</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell coarser work; for he the panniers made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith the farmers use their beasts to lade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And divers kinds of baskets, huge and rough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handy and light. Ay, he had skill enough!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And likewise brooms of millet-grass, and such⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And baskets of split-cane. And still his touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was sure and swift; and all his wares were strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found a ready sale the farms among.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now, from fallow field and moorland vast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The labourers were trooping home at last.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then hasted sweet Mirèio to prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her own hands and in the open air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their evening meal. There was a broad flat stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Served for a table, and she set thereon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One mighty dish, where each man plunged his ladle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our weavers wrought meanwhile upon their cradle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until Ramoun, the master of the farm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried, “How is this?”⁠—brusque was his tone and warm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come to your supper, Ambroi: no declining!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put up the crib, my man: the stars are shining.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, Mirèio, run and fetch a bowl:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The travellers must be weary, on my soul!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wherefore the basket-weaver, well-content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose with his son and to the table went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sat him down and cut the bread for both;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While bright Mirèio hasted, nothing loth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seasoned a dish of beans with olive oil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And came and sat before them with a smile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not quite fifteen was this same fair Mirèio.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, me! the purple coast of Font Vièio,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hills of Baux, the desolate Crau plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shape like hers will hardly see again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Child of the merry sun, her dimpled face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bloomed into laughter with ingenious grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eyes had she limpid as the drops of dew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when she fixed their tender gaze on you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow was not. Stars in a summer night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are not more softly, innocently bright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beauteous hair, all waves and rings of jet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breasts, a double peach, scarce ripened yet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Shy, yet a joyous little sprite she was;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, finding all her sweetness in a glass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You would have drained it at a single breath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to our tale, which somewhat lingereth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When every man his day’s toil had rehearsed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(So, at my father’s farm, I heard them first)⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, Ambroi, for a song!” they all began:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let us not sleep above our supper, man!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, “Peace! peace! My friends, do ye not know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On every jester, God, they say, doth blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sets him spinning like a top along?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing yourselves, lads⁠—you who are young and strong.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No jest, good father, none!” they answered him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But, since the wine o’erflows your goblet’s brim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink with us, Ambroi, and then to your song!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, ay, when I was young⁠—but that was long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ago⁠—I’d sing to any man’s desire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now my voice is but a broken lyre.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, Master Ambroi,” urged Mirèio,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sing one song, please, because ’twill cheer us so.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My pretty one,” the weaver said again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Only the husks of my old voice remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if these please you, I cannot say nay,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drained his goblet, and began straightway:⁠—</span>

				<span>A timely ending thus the minstrel made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else the fast-coming tears his tale had stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for the labourers⁠—they sat intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mute all, with parted lips, and forward bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if enchanted. Even when he was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a brief space they seemed to hearken on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And such were aye the songs,” said the old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sung in the good old days when Martha span.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long-winded, maybe, and the tunes were queer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, youngsters, what of that? They suit my ear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your new French airs mayhap may finer be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But no one understands the words, you see!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereon the men, somewhat as in a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From table rose, and to the running stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They led their patient mules, six yoke in all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long vine-branches from a trellised wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waved o’er them waiting, and, from time to time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Humming some fragment of the weaver’s rhyme.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mirèio tarried, but not quite alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A social spirit had the little one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she and Vincen chatted happily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas a fair sight, the two young heads to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meeting and parting, coming still and going</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like aster-flowers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> when merry winds are blowing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now tell me, Vincen,” thus Mirèio,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If oftentimes as you and Ambroi go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing your burdens the wild country over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some haunted castle you do not discover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or joyous fête, or shining palace meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the home-nest is evermore our seat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Tis even so, my lady, as you think.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, currants quench the thirst as well as drink!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What though we brave all weathers in our toil?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure, we have joys that rain-drops cannot spoil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sun of noon beats fiercely on the head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there are wayside trees unnumberèd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And whenso’er return the summer hours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And olive-trees are all bedecked with flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We hunt the whitening orchards curiously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still following the scent, till we descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hot noontide, by its emerald flash,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tiny cantharis upon the ash.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The shops will buy the same. Or off we tramp</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gather red-oak apples in the swamp,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or beat the pond for leeches. Ah, that’s grand!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You need nor bait nor hook, but only stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strike the water, and then one by one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They come and seize your legs, and all is done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And thou wert never at Li Santo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> even!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dear heart! The singing there must be like heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis there they bring the sick from all about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For healing; and the church is small, no doubt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, ah, what cries they lift! what vows they pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great saints! We saw it one fête-day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It was the year of the great miracle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My God, that was a sight! I mind it well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A feeble boy, beautiful as Saint John,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay on the pavement, sadly calling on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saints to give sight to his poor blind eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And promising his pet lamb in sacrifice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘My little lamb, with budding horns!’ he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Dear saints!’ How we all wept! Then from o’erhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blessed reliquaries came down slowly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the throngèd people bending lowly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crying, ‘Come, great saints, mighty and good!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, save!’ The church was like a wind-swept wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then the godmother held the child aloft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who spread abroad his fingers pale and soft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And passionately grasped the reliquaries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That held the bones of the three blessed Maries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as a drowning man, who cannot swim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will clutch a plank the sea upheaves to him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And then, oh! then⁠—I saw it with these eyes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By faith illumined, the blind boy outcries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I see the sacred relics, and I see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grandmother all in tears! Now haste,’ said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘My lambkin with the budding horns to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dear saints for a thank-offering!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But thou, my lady, God keep thee, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome and happy as thou art to-day!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet if a lizard, wolf, or horrid snake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever should wound thee with its fang, betake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thyself forthwith to the most holy saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who cure all ills and hearken all complaints.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the hours of the summer evening passed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard-by the big-wheeled cart its shadow cast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the white yard. Afar arose and fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The frequent tinkle of a little bell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dark marsh: a nightingale sang yonder;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An owl made dreamy, sorrowful rejoinder.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, since the night is moonlit, so the mere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trees are glorified, wilt thou not hear,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boy besought, “the story of a race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which I hoped to win the prize?”⁠—“Ah, yes!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little maiden sighed; and, more than glad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still gazed with parted lips upon the lad.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well, then, Mirèio, once at Nismes,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“They had foot-races on the esplanade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on a certain day a crowd was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Collected, thicker than a shock of hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some shoeless, coatless, hatless, were to run:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The others only came to see the fun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When all at once upon the scene appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One Lagalanto, prince of foot-racers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all Provence, and even in Italy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fleetest-footed far behind left he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes: Lagalanto, the great Marseillais⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt have heard his name before to-day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A leg, a thigh, he had would not look small</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By John of Cossa’s, the great seneschal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his dresser many a pewter plate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all his victories carved thereon in state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you’d have said, to see his scarfs, my lady,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wainscot all festooned with rainbows had he.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The other runners, of whate’er condition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw on their clothes at this dread apparition:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The game was up when Lagalanto came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only one stout-limbed lad, Lou Cri by name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who into Nismes had driven cows that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Durst challenge the victorious Marseillais.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whereon, ‘Oh, bah!’ cried foolish little I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Just think!⁠—I only chanced to stand thereby),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I can run too!’ Forthwith they all surround me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Run, then!’ Alas! my foolish words confound me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I had run with partridges alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only the old oaks for lookers-on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But now was no escape. ‘My poor boy, hasten,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Says Lagalanto, ‘and your latchets fasten.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, so I did. And the great man meanwhile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew o’er his mighty muscles, with a smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pair of silken hose, whereto were sewn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ten tiny golden bells of sweetest tone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So ’twas we three. Each set between his teeth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bit of willow, thus to save his breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shook hands all round; then, one foot on the line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trembling and eager we await the sign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For starting. It is given. Off we fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We scour the plain like mad⁠—’tis you! ’tis I!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wrapped in a cloud of dust, with smoking hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We strain each nerve. Ah, what a race was there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They thought we should have won the goal abreast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I, presumptuous, sprang before the rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that was my undoing; for I dropped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale, dying as it seemed. But never stopped</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The others. On, on, on, with steady gait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just like the pasteboard horses at Aix fête.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The famous Marseillais thought he must win</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(They used to say of him he had no spleen);</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, ah! my lady, on that day of days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found his man⁠—Lou Cri of Mouriès.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For now they pass beyond the gazing line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And almost touch the goal. O beauty mine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couldst thou have seen Lou Cri leap forward then!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never, I think, in mountain, park, or glen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stag, a hare, so fleet of foot you’d find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howled like a wolf the other, just behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lou Cri is victor!⁠—hugs the post for joy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then all of Nismes comes flocking round the boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To learn the birthplace of this wondrous one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pewter plate is flashing in the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hautboys flourish, cymbals clang apace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he receives the guerdon of the race.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And Lagalanto?” asks Mirèio.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why, he upon the ground was sitting low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Powdered with dust, the shifting folk among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clasping his knees. With shame his soul was wrung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, with the drops that from his forehead fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came tears of bitterness unspeakable.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lou Cri approached, and made a modest bow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Brother, let’s to the ale-house arbour now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind the amphitheatre. Why borrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon this festive day, tears for the morrow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The money left we’ll drink together thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s sunshine yet enough for both of us.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then trembling rose the runner of Marseilles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from his limbs made haste to tear away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silken hose, the golden bells. ‘Here, lad!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raising his pallid face, ‘take them!’ he said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I am grown old; youth decks thee like a swan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So put the strong man’s gear with honour on.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He turned, stricken like an ash the storm bereaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In summer-time of all its tower of leaves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king of runners vanished from the place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never more ran he in any race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor even leaped on the inflated hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In games at Saint John’s or <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s tide.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Vincen told the story, waxing warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all he’d seen, before the Lotus Farm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His cheeks grew red, his eyes were full of light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He waved his hand to point his speech aright⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abundant was the same as showers in May</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fall upon a field of new-mown hay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The crickets, chirruping amid the dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paused more than once to listen. Often, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bird of evening, the sweet nightingale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept silence; thrilling so at Vincen’s tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As aye she harked her leafy perch upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have kept awake until the dawn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, mother!” cried Mirèio, “surely never</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was weaver-lad so marvellously clever!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love to sleep, dear, on a winter night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now I cannot⁠—it is all too light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, just one story more before we go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I could pass a lifetime listening so!”</span>
