			<p>
				<span>When the crop is fair in the olive-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the earthen jars are ready</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the golden oil from the barrels poured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the big cart rocks unsteady</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its tower of gathered sheaves, and strains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And groans on its way through fields and lanes;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When brawny and bare as an old athlete</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Comes Bacchus the dance a-leading,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the labourers all, with juice-dyed feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vintage of Crau are treading,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the good wine pours from the brimful presses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ruddy foam in the vats increases;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When under the leaves of the Spanish broom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The clear silk-worms are holden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An artist each, in a tiny loom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weaving a web all golden⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fine, frail cells out of sunlight spun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where they creep and sleep by the million⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Glad is Provence on a day like that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis the time of jest and laughter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Ferigoulet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a> and the Baume Muscat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They quaff, and they sing thereafter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lads and lasses, their toils between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dance to the tinkling tambourine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Methinks, good neighbours, I am Fortune’s pet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne’er in my trellised arbor saw I yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A silkier bower, cocoons more worthy praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or richer harvest, since the year of grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first I laid my hand on Ramoun’s arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And came, a youthful bride, to Lotus Farm.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake Jano Mario, Ramoun’s wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fond, proud mother who had given life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To our Mirèio. Unto her had hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while were gathered the cocoons outside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her neighbours. In the silk-worm-room they throng;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as they aid the picking, gossip long.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To these Mirèio tendered now and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oak-sprigs and sprays of rosemary; for when</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The worms, lured by the mountain odour, come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In myriads, there to make their silken home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sprays and sprigs, adornèd in such wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are like the golden palms of Paradise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On Mother Mary’s altar yesterday,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jano Mario said, “I went to lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My finer sprays, by way of tithe. And so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do each year; for you, my women, know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, when the holy Mother will, ’tis she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sendeth up the worms abundantly.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, for my part,” said Zèu of Host Farm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Great fears have I my worms will come to harm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You mind that ugly day the east wind blew⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I left my window open⁠—if you knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever such folly!⁠—and to my affright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon my floor are twenty, now turned white.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Zèu thus the crone Taven replied⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A witch, who from the cliffs of Baux had hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help at the cocooning: “Youth is bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The young think they know better than the old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And age is torment, and we mourn the fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which bids us see and know⁠—but all too late,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye are such giddy women, every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, if the hatching promise well, ye run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway about the streets the tale to tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Come see my silk-worms! ’Tis incredible</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fine they are!’ Envy can well dissemble:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She hastens to your room, her heart a-tremble</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With wrath. And ‘Well done, neighbour!’ she says cheerly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘This does one good! You’ve still your caul<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> on, clearly!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when your head is turned, she casts upon ’em⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The envious one⁠—a look so full of venom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It knots and burns ’em up. And then you say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was the east wind plastered ’em that way!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I don’t say that has naught to do with it,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth Zèu. “Still it had been quite as fit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For me to close the window.”⁠—“Doubt you, then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The harm the eye can do,” went on Taven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“When in the head it glistens balefully?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Zèu scanned, herself with piercing eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye are such fools, ye seem to think,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That scraping with a scalpel on the dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would win its honey-secret from the bee!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But may not a fierce look, now answer me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The unborn babe for evermore deform,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dry the cow’s milk in her udders warm?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“An owl may fascinate a little bird;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A serpent, flying geese, as I have heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How high soe’er they mount. And if one keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fixed gaze upon silk-worms, will they sleep?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moreover, is there, neighbours, in the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So wise a virgin that she can withstand</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The fiery eyes of passionate youth?” Here stopped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hag, and damsels four their cocoons dropped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“In June as in October,” murmuring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Her tongue hath evermore a barbèd sting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ancient viper! What the lads, say you?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them come, then! We’ll see what they can do?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But other merry ones retorted, “No!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We want them not! Do we, Mirèio?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not we! Nor is it always cocooning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So I’ll a bottle from the cellar bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you will find delicious.” And she fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the house because her cheeks grew red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, friends,” said haughty Lauro, with decision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This is my mind, though poor be my condition:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll smile on no one, even though my lover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As king of fairy-land his realm should offer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pleasure were it, could I see him lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seven long years before my footstool sighing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah!” said Clemenço, “should a king me woo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say he loved me, without much ado</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d grant the royal suit! And chiefly thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were he a young king and a glorious.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A king of men, in beauty, I’d let come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And freely lead me to his palace home!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But see! If I were once enthronèd there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sovereign and an empress, in a fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mantle bedecked, of golden-flowered brocade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pearls and emeralds dazzling round my head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would my heart for my poor country yearn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, the queen, would unto Baux return.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I would make my capital at Baux,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the rock where lie its ruins low</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would rebuild our ancient castle, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A white tower on the top thereof should stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose head should touch the stars. Thither retiring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If rest or solace were the queen desiring,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We’d climb the turret-stair, my prince and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gladly throw the crown and mantle by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would it not be blissful with my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aloft, alone to sit, the world above?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, leaned upon the parapet by his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To search the lovely landscape far and wide,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Our own glad kingdom of Provence descrying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like some great orange-grove beneath us lying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All fair? And, ever stretching dreamily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the hills and plains, the sapphire sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While noble ships, tricked out with streamers gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just graze the Château d’If, and pass away?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or we would turn to lightning-scathed Ventour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, while the lesser heights before him cower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hoary head against the heaven raises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I have seen, in solitary places</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of beech and pine, with staff in agèd hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some shepherd-chief, his flock o’erlooking, stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Again, we’d follow the great Rhône awhile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown whose banks the cities brave defile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dip their lips and drink, with dance and song.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stately is the Rhône’s march, and very strong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But even he must bend at Avignon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His haughty head to Notre Dame des Doms.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or watch the ever-varying Durance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now like some fierce and ravenous goat advance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Devouring banks and bridges; now demure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As maid from rustic well who bears her ewer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spilling her scanty water as she dallies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every youth along her pathway rallies.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake her sweet Provençal majesty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rose with brimful apron, and put by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her gathered treasure. Two more maids were there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twin sisters, the one dark, the other fair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Azaläis, Viòulano. The stronghold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Estoublon sheltered their parents old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And oft these two to Lotus Farmstead came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While that mischievous lad, Cupid by name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loves to sport with generous hearts and tender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made the sisters both their love surrender</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the same youth. So Azaläis said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dark one⁠—lifting up her raven head:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, damsels, play awhile that I were queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Marseilles ships, the Beaucaire meadows green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiling La Ciotat, and fair Salon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all her almond trees, to me belong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the young maids I’d summon by decree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Arles, Baux, Barbentano, unto me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Come, fly like birds!’ the order should be given;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, of these, would choose the fairest seven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And royal charge upon the same would lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The false love and the true in scales to weigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then would merry counsel holden be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sure it is a great calamity</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That half of those who love, with love most meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can never marry, and their joy complete.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when I, Azaläis, hold the helm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I proclamation make, that in my realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True lovers wounded in their cruel sport</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall aye find mercy at the maiden’s court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if one sell her robe of honour white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether it be for gold or jewel bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if one offer insult, or betray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fond heart, unto such as these alway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The high court of the seven maids shall prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stern avenger of offended love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if two lovers the same maid desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if two maids to the same lad aspire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My council’s duty it shall be to choose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which loves the better, which the better sues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And which is worthier of a happy fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moreover, on my maidens there shall wait</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Seven sweet poets, who from time to time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall write the laws of love in lovely rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon wild vine-leaves or the bark of trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sometimes, in a stately chorus, these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will sing the same, and then their couplets all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like honey from the honey-comb will fall.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, long ago, the whispering pines among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faneto de Gautèume may have sung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she the glory of her star-crowned head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Roumanin and on the Alpines shed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Countess Dio, of the passionate lays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who held her courts of love in the old days.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now Mirèio, to the room returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With face as radiant as an Easter morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A flagon bore; and, for their spirits’ sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besought them all her beverage to partake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For this will make us work with heartier will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So come, good women, and your goblets fill!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, pouring from the wicker-covered flask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A generous drink for whosoe’er might ask,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(A string of gold the falling liquor made),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I mixed this cordial mine own self,” she said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“One leaves it in a window forty days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it may mellow in the sun’s hot rays.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Herein are mountain herbs, in number three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The liquor keeps their odour perfectly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It strengthens one.” Here brake in other voices:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Listen, Mirèio! Tell us what your choice is;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these have told what they would do, if they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were queens, or came to great estate one day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In such a case, Mirèio, what would you?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who, I? How can I tell what I would do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am so happy in our own La Crau</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my dear parents, wherefore should I go?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, ha!” outspake another maiden bold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Little care you for silver or for gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But on a certain morn, I mind it well⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me, dear, that I the tale should tell!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas Tuesday: I had gathered sticks that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, fagot on my hip, had won my way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost to La Crous-Blanco, when I ’spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You in a tree, with some one by your side</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who chatted gayly. A lithe form he had”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whence did he come?” they cried. “Who was the lad?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Noro, “To tell that were not so easy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because among the thick-leaved mulberry-trees he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was hidden half; yet think I ’twas the clever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen, the Valabregan basket-weaver!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh!” cried the damsels all, with peals of laughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“See you not what the little cheat was after?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pretty basket she would fain receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made this poor boy in her love believe!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fairest maiden the whole country over</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has chosen the barefoot Vincen for her lover!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So mocked they, till o’er each young countenance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In turn there fell a dark and sidelong glance⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taven’s⁠—who cried, “A thousand curses fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon you, and the vampire seize you all!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the good Lord from heaven this way came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You girls, I think, would giggle all the same.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Tis brave to laugh at this poor lad of osiers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mark! the future may make strange disclosures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor though he be. Now hear the oracle!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God in his house once wrought a miracle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I can show the truth of what I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, lasses, it all happened in my day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Once, in the wild woods of the Luberon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A shepherd kept his flock. His days were long;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when at last the same were well-nigh spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toward the grave his iron frame was bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sought the hermit of Saint Ouquèri,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make his last confession piously.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alone, in the Vaumasco valley lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His foot had never sacred threshold crost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he partook his first communion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even his prayers were from his memory gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now he rose and left his cottage lowly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And came and bowed before the hermit holy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘With what sin chargest thou thyself, my brother?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The solitary said. Replied the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged man, ‘Once, long ago, I slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little bird about my flock that flew⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cruel stone I flung its life to end:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was a wagtail, and the shepherds’ friend.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Is this a simple soul,’ the hermit thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Or is it an impostor?’ And he sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right curiously to read the old man’s face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, to solve the riddle, ‘Go,’ he says,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘And hang thy shepherd’s cloak yon beam upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And afterward I will absolve my son.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A single sunbeam through the chapel strayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there it was the priest the suppliant bade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hang his cloak! But the good soul arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drew it off with mien of all repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And threw it upward. And it hung in sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suspended on the slender shaft of light!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then fell the hermit prostrate on the floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Oh, man of God!’ he cried, and he wept sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Let but the blessed hand these tears bedew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfil the sacred office for us two!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sins of thine can I absolve, ’tis clear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou art the saint, and I the sinner here!’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her story ended, the crone said no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all the laughter of the maids was o’er.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only Laureto dared one little joke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This tells us ne’er to laugh at any cloak!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good may the beast be, although rough the hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, girls, methought young mistress I espied</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Grow crimson as an autumn grape, because</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen’s dear name so lightly uttered was.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There’s mystery here! Mirèio, we are jealous!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lasted the picking long that day? Pray, tell us!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When two friends meet, the hour is winged with pleasure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for a lover, one has always leisure!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, fie!” Mirèio said. “Enough of joking!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mind your work now, and be not so provoking!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You would make swear the very saints! But I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Promise you one and all, most faithfully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll seek a convent while my years are tender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sooner than e’er my maiden heart surrender!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then brake the damsels into merry chorus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have we not pretty Magali before us?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love and lovers held in such disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, to escape their torment, she was fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Saint Blasi’s in Arles away to hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bury her sweet self from every eye.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come, Noro, you, whose voice is ever thrilling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who charm us all, sing now, if you are willing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The song of Magali, the cunning fairy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love had shunned by all devices airy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bird, a vine, a sunbeam she became,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet fell herself, love’s victim all the same!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Queen of my soul!” sang Noro, and the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell straightway to their work with twofold zest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as, when one cicala doth begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its high midsummer note, the rest fall in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swell the chorus, so the damsels here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the refrain with voices loud and clear:⁠—</span>
