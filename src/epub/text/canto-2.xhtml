				<span class="i6">As the green leaves you gather!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">In their third sleep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> the silk-worms lie,</span>

				<span class="i6">And lovely is the weather</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">Like brown bees that in open glades</span>

				<span class="i6">From rosemary gather honey,</span>

			<p>
				<span>It chanced one morn⁠—it was May’s loveliest⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio gathered leaves among the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It chanced, moreover, on that same May morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little gypsy, for her own adorning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had cherries in her ears, for rings, suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as our Vincen’s footsteps thither tended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like Latin seaside people everywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wore a red cap on his raven hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a cock’s feather gayly set therein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, prancing onward, with a stick made spin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flints from wayside stone-heaps, and set flying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lazy adders in his pathway lying.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When suddenly, from the straight, leafy alley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither so fast?” a voice comes musically.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio’s. Vincen darts beneath the trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks up, and soon the merry maiden sees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perched on a mulberry-tree, she eyed the lad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like some gray-crested lark,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> and he was glad.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How then, Mirèio, comes the picking on?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little by little, all will soon be done!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May I not help thee?”⁠—“That were very meet,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She said, and laughed upon her airy seat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang Vincen like a squirrel from the clover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran nimbly up the tree, and said, moreover⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now since old Master Ramoun hath but thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come down, I pray, and strip the lower tree!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll to the top!” As busily the maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought on, she murmured, “How the soul doth gladden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have good company! There’s little joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lonely work!”⁠—“Ay is there!” said the boy:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For when in our old hut we sit alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Father and I, and only hear the Rhône</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rush headlong o’er the shingle, ’tis most drear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not in the pleasant season of the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For then upon our travels we are bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trudge from farm to farm the country round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But when the holly-berries have turned red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winter comes, and nights are long,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And sitting by the dying fire we catch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whistle or mew of goblin at the latch;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I must wait till bed-time there with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaking but seldom, and the room so dim,”⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Broke in the happy girl, unthinkingly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah! but your mother, Vincen, where is she?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother is dead.” The two were still awhile:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he, “But Vinceneto could beguile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The time when she was there. A little thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she could keep the hut.”⁠—“I’m wondering⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You have a sister, Vincen?”⁠—“That have I!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A merry lass and good,” was the reply:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For down at Font-dou-Rèi, in Beaucaire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither she went to glean, she was so fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deft at work that all were smitten by her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there she stays as servant by desire.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And you are like her?”⁠—“Now that makes me merry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, she is blonde, and I brown as a berry!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wouldst thou know whom she is like, the elf?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, even like thee, Mirèio, thine own self!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your two bright heads, with all their wealth of hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like myrtle-leaves, would make a perfect pair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, ah! thou knowest better far to gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The muslin of thy cap<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a> than doth the other!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My little sister is not plain nor dull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou⁠—thou art so much more beautiful!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh, what a Vincen!” cried Mirèio,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And suddenly the half-culled branch let go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i5">Sing, <i xml:lang="oc">magnarello</i>, merrily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">As the green leaves you gather!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">In their third sleep the silk-worms lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">And lovely is the weather.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">Like brown bees that in open glades</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">From rosemary gather honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">The mulberry-trees swarm full of maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">Glad as the air is sunny!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And so you fancy I am fair to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairer than Vinceneto?” “That I do!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But what advantage have I more than she?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother divine!” he cried, impetuously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That of the goldfinch o’er the fragile wren⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grace for the eye⁠—song for the hearts of men</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What more? Ah, my poor sister! Hear me speak⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt not get the white out of the leek:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes are like the water of the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blue, clear⁠—thine, black, and they flash gloriously.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, O Mirèio! when on me they shine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seem to drain a bumper of cooked wine!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My sister hath a silver voice and mellow⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love to hear her sing the <i xml:lang="oc">Peirounello</i>⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, ah! my sweet young lady, every word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou’st given me my spirit more hath stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My ear more thrilled, my very heart-strings wrung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than a thousand songs divinely sung!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With roaming all the pastures in the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My little sister’s face and neck are dun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As dates; but thou, most fair one, I think well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art fashioned like the flowers of Asphodel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the bold Summer with his tawny hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dare not caress thy forehead white and bland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Moreover, Vinceneto is more slim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than dragon-flies that o’er the brooklet skim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor child! In one year grew she up to this;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But verily in thy shape is naught amiss.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again Mirèio, turning rosy red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let fall her branch, and “What a Vincen!” said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i5">Sing, <i xml:lang="oc">magnarello</i>, merrily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">The green leaves ever piling!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">Two comely children sit on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">Amid the foliage, smiling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">Sing, <i xml:lang="oc">magnarello</i>, loud and oft:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">Your merry labour hasten.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">The guileless pair who laugh aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">Are learning love’s first lesson.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cleared from the hills meanwhile the mists of morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the ruined towers, whither return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nightly the grim old lords of Baux, they say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the barren rocks ’gan take their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vultures,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a> whose large, white wings are seen to gleam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resplendent in the noontide’s burning beam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then cried the maiden, pouting, “We have done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naught! Oh, shame to idle so! <em>Some one</em></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said he would help me; and that some one still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doth naught but talk, and make me laugh at will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Work now, lest mother say I am unwary</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And idle, and too awkward yet to marry!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! my brave friend, I think should one engage you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pick leaves by the quintal, and for wage, you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would all the same sit still and feast your eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handling the ready sprays in dreamy wise!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat the boy, a trifle disconcerted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And so thou takest me for a gawky!” blurted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We’ll see, my fair young lady,” added he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Which of us two the better picker be!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ply both hands now. With vast animation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bend and strip the branches. No occasion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For rest or idle chatter either uses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The bleating sheep, they say, her mouthful loses),</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until the mulberry-tree is bare of leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these the ready sack at once receives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At whose distended mouth⁠—ah, youth is sweet!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio’s pretty taper hand will meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In strange entanglement that somehow lingers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Vincen’s, with its brown and burning fingers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Both started. In their cheeks the flush rose higher:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They felt the heat of some mysterious fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They dropped the mulberry-leaves as if afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, tremulous with passion, the boy said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What aileth thee, my lady? answer me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did any hidden hornet dare sting thee?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well-nigh inaudible, with head bent low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I know not, Vincen,”⁠—thus Mirèio.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so they turned a few more leaves to gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for a while spake not again, but rather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exchanged bright looks and sidelong, saying well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one who first should laugh, would break the spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their hearts beat high, the green leaves fell like rain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when the time for sacking came again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether by chance or by contrivance, yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The white hand and the brown hand always met.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor seemed there any lack of happiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while their labour failed not to progress.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i5">Sing, <i xml:lang="oc">magnarello</i>, merrily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">As the green leaves you gather!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">The sun of May is riding high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">And ardent is the weather.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now suddenly Mirèio whispered, “Hark!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What can that be?” and listened like a lark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a vine, her small forefinger pressing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against her lip, and eager eyes addressing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a bird’s nest upon a leafy bough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just opposite the one where she was now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! wait a little while!” with bated breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the young basket-weaver answereth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a sparrow hopped from limb to limb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the nest. Down in the tree-trunk dim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close peering through a crevice in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full-fledged and lively saw he the young brood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, sitting firmly the rough bough astride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung with one hand, and let the other glide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the hollow trunk. Above his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio leaned with her cheeks rosy red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What sort?” she whispered from her covert shady.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Beauties!”⁠—“But what?”⁠—“Blue tomtits, my young lady!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then laughed the maiden, and her laugh was gay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“See, Vincen! Have you never heard them say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when two find a nest in company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On mulberry, or any other tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Church within a year will join those two?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And proverbs, father says, are always true.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea,” quoth the lad; “but do not thou forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this, our happy hope, may perish yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If all the birdies be not caged forthwith.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Jesu divine!” the maiden murmureth:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Put them by quickly! It concerns us much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our birdies should be safe from alien touch.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why, then, the very safest place,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Methinks, Mirèio, would thy bodice be!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh, surely!” So the lad explores the hollow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hand withdrawing full of tomtits callow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Four were they; and the maid in ecstacy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cries “<i xml:lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>” and lifts her hands on high.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How many! What a pretty brood it is!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There! There, poor darlings, give me just one kiss!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, lavishing a thousand fond caresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tenderly, carefully, the four she presses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inside her waist, obeying Vincen’s will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While he, “Hold out thy hands! there are more still!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh sweet! The little eyes in each blue head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are sharp as needles,” as Mirèio said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softly, three more of the wee brood she pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into their smooth, white prison with the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, when bestowed within that refuge warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought they were in their nest and safe from harm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Are there more, Vincen?”⁠—“Ay!” he answered her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then, Holy Virgin! you’re a sorcerer!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou simple maid! About <abbr>St.</abbr> George’s day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ten, twelve, and fourteen eggs, these tomtits lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, often. Now let these the others follow!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the last: so good-bye, pretty hollow!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But ere the words were spoken, and the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her flowered neckerchief had fairly laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her little charge, she gave a piercing wail:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh me! oh me!” then murmured, and turned pale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, laying both her hands upon her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moaned, “I am dying!” and was sore distressed,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And could but weep: “Ah, they are scratching me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sting! Come quickly, Vincent, up the tree!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For on the last arrival had ensued</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wondrous commotion in the hidden brood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fledglings latest taken from the nest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had sore disorder wrought among the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because within so very small a valley</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All could not lie at ease, so must they gayly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scramble with claw and wing down either slope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up the gentle hills, thus to find scope:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand tiny somersets they turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand pretty rolls they seem to learn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And “Ah, come quick!” is still the maiden’s cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trembling like vine-spray when the wind is high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or like a heifer stung with cattle-flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as she bends and writhes in piteous wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaps Vincen upward till he plants his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once more beside her on her airy seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i5">Sing, <i xml:lang="oc">magnarello</i>, heap your leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">While sunny is the weather!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">He comes to aid her when she grieves:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i6">The two are now together.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou likest not this tickling?” kindly said he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What if thou wert like me, my gentle lady,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hadst to wander barefoot through the nettles?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So proffering his red sea-cap, there he settles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fast as she draws them from her neckerchief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The birdies, to Mirèio’s vast relief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet ah, poor dear, the downcast eyes of her!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She dares not look at her deliverer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a brief space. But soon a smile ensues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the tears vanish, as the morning dews</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That drench the flowers and grass at break of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll into little pearls and pass away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then there came a fresh catastrophe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The branch whereon they sat ensconced in glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snapped, broke asunder, and with ringing shriek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio flung her arms round Vincen’s neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he clasped hers, and they whirled suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down through the leaves upon the supple rye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Listen, wind of the Greek,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a> wind of the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shake no more the verdant canopy!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hush for one moment, O thou childish breeze!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathe soft and whisper low, beholding these!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give them a little time to dream of bliss⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dream at least, in such a world as this!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou too, swift streamlet of the prattling voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace, prithee! In this hour, make little noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the vocal pebbles of thy bed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, little noise! Because two souls have sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one bright region. Leave them there, to roam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the starry heights⁠—their proper home!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A moment, and she struggled to be free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his embrace. The flower of the quince-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not so pale. Then backward the two sank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gazed at one another on the bank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the weaver’s son the silence brake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus in seeming wrath arose and spake:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Shame on thee, thou perfidious mulberry!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A devil’s tree! A Friday-planted tree!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blight seize and wood-louse eat thee! May thy master</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold thee in horror for this day’s disaster!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me thou art not hurt, Mirèio!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trembling from head to foot, she answered, “No:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am not hurt; but as a baby weeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knows not why⁠—there’s something here that keeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perpetual tumult in my heart. A pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blinds me and deafens me, and fills my brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that my blood in a tumultuous riot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courses my body through, and won’t be quiet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“May it not be,” the simple boy replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou fearest to have thy mother come and chide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy tardy picking⁠—as when I come back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Late from the blackberry-field with face all black,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tattered clothes?” Mirèio sighed again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, no! This is another kind of pain!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or possibly a sun-stroke may have lighted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon thee!” And the eager Vincen cited</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ancient crone among the hills of Baux,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taven by name, “who on the forehead⁠—so⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A glass of water sets: the ray malign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dazed brain for the crystal will resign.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, nay!” impetuously the maiden cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Floods of May sunshine never terrified</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The girls of Crau. Why should I hold you waiting?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen, in vain my heart is palpitating!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My secret cannot bide a home so small:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love you, Vincen, love you!⁠—That is all!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The river-banks, the close-pruned willows hoary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green grass and ambient air, hearing this story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were full of glee. But the poor basket-weaver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Princess, that thou who art so fair and clever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst have a tongue given to wicked lying!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, it confounds me! It is stupefying!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What! thou in love with me? Mirèio,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My poor life is yet happy. Do not go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make a jest thereof! I might believe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just for one moment, and thereafter grieve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul to death. Ah, no! my pretty maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laugh no more at me in this wise!” he said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now may God shut me out of Paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen, if I have ever told you lies!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go to! I love you! Will that kill you, friend?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if you <em>will</em> be cruel, and so send</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me from your side, ’tis I who will fall ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at your feet lie low till sorrow kill!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No more! no more!” cried Vincen, desperately:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is a gulf ’twixt thee and me! The stately</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Queen of the Lotus Farm art thou, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bow at thy coming, hasten to thy call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While I, a vagrant weaver, only wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plying my trade from Valabrègo yonder.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What care I?” cried the fiery girl at once.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sharp as a sheaf-binder’s came her response.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“May not my lover, then, a baron be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or eke a weaver, if he pleases me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if you will not have me pine away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why look so handsome, even in rags, I say?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He turned and faced her. Ah, she was enchanting!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as a charmèd bird falls dizzy, panting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So he. “Mirèio, thou’rt a sorceress!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I bedazzled by thy loveliness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy voice, too, mounts into this head of mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes me like a man o’ercome with wine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why, can it be, Mirèio? Seest thou not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even now with thy embrace my brain is hot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am a pack-bearer, and well may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A laughing-stock for evermore to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou shalt have the truth, dear, in this hour:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love thee, with a love that could devour!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wert thou to ask⁠—lo, love I thee so much!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden goat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> that ne’er felt mortal touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon its udders, but doth only lick</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moss from the base of the precipitous peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Baux⁠—I’d perish in the quarries there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or bring thee down the goat with golden hair!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So much, that, if thou saidst, ‘I want a star,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is no stream so wild, no sea so far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I would cross; no headsman, steel or fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could withhold me. Yea, I would climb higher</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than peaks that kiss the sky, that star to wrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Sunday thou shouldst wear it on thy breast!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O my Mirèio! Ever as I gaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy beauty fills me with a deep amaze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once, when by Vaucluse grotto I was going,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw a fig-tree in the bare rock growing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So very spare it was, the lizards gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had found more shade beneath a jasmine spray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, round about the roots, once every year</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The neighbouring stream comes gushing, as I hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the shrub drinks the water as it rises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that one drink for the whole year suffices.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even as the gem is cut to fit the ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This parable to us is answering.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am the fig-tree on the barren mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, mine own, art the reviving fountain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely it would suffice me, could I feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, once a year, I might before thee kneel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sun myself in thy sweet face, and lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lips unto thy fingers, as to-day!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Trembling with love, Mirèio hears him out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lets him wind his arms her neck about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clasp her as bewildered. Suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the green walk, quavers an old wife’s cry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How now, Mirèio? Are you coming soon?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What will the silk-worms have to eat at noon?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As ofttimes, at the coming on of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A flock of sparrows on a pine alight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fill the air with joyous chirruping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, if a passing gleaner pause and fling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stone that way, they to the neighbouring wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By terror winged, their instant flight make good;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, with a tumult of emotion thrilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled the enamoured two across the field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when, her leaves upon her head, the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned silently toward the farm, he stayed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vincen⁠—and breathless watched her in her flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the fallow, till she passed from sight.</span>
