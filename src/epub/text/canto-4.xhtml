			<p>
				<span class="i1">When violets are blue in the blue shadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Of the o’erhanging trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth who stray in pairs about the meadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Are glad to gather these.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">When peace descends upon the troubled Ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">And he his wrath forgets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flock from Martigue the boats with wing-like motion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">The fishes fill their nets.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">And when the girls of Crau bloom into beauty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">(And fairer earth knows not),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye are there suitors ready for their duty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">In castle and in cot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus to Mirèio’s home came seeking her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A trio notable⁠—a horse-tamer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A herdsman, and a shepherd. It befell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last was first who came his tale to tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alari was his name, a wealthy man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had a thousand sheep, the story ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The same were wont to feed the winter long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rich salt-pastures by Lake Entressen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at wheat-boiling time, in burning May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself would often lead his flock, they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up through the hills to pastures green and high:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They say moreover, and full faith have I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever as <abbr>St.</abbr> Mark’s came round again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nine noted shearers Alari would retain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three days to shear his flock. Added to these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man to bear away each heavy fleece,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a sheep-boy who back and forward ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And filled the shearer’s quickly emptied can.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the summer heats began to fail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the high peaks to feel the snowy gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stately sight it was that flock to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wind from the upper vales of Dauphiny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the Crau pursue their devious ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the toothsome winter grass to graze.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Also to watch them there where they defile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the stony road were well worth while;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The early lambkins all the rest outstripping</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And merrily about the lamb-herd leaping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bell-decked asses with their foals beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or following after them. These had for guide</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A drover, who a patient mule bestrode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its wattled panniers bare a motley load:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Food for the shepherd-folk, and flasks of wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the still bleeding hides of slaughtered kine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And folded garments whereon oft there lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some weakly lamb, a-weary of the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next came abreast⁠—the captains of the host⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five fiery bucks, their fearsome heads uptost:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bells loud jingling and with sidelong glances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And backward curving horns, each one advances.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sober mothers follow close behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striving their lawless little kids to mind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A rude troop and a ravenous they are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these the goat-herd hath in anxious care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after them there follow presently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great ram-chiefs, with muzzles lifted high:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You know them by the heavy horn that lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice curved about the ear in curious wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their ribs and backs with tufts of wool are decked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may have their meed of due respect</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the flock’s grandsires. Plain to all beholders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sheepskin cloak folded about his shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strides the chief-shepherd next, with lordly swing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The main corps of his army following.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tumbling through clouds of dust, the great ewe-dams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call with loud bleatings to their bleating lambs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little hornèd ones are gayly drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tiny tufts of scarlet on the breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the neck. While, filling the next place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woolly sheep advance at solemn pace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid the tumult now and then the cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of shepherd-boy to shepherd-dog arise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the pitch-marked herd innumerable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Press forward: yearlings, two-year-olds as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those who have lost their lambs, and those who bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twin lambs unborn⁠—and wearily they fare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A ragamuffin troop brings up the rear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The barren and past-breeding ewes are here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lame, the toothless, and the remnant sorry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of many a mighty ram, lean now and hoary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who from his earthly labours long hath rested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of honour and of horns alike divested.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All these who fill the road and mountain-passes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old, young, good, bad, and neither; sheep, goats, asses⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are Alari’s, every one. He stands the while</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watches them, a hundred in a file,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass on before him; and the man’s eyes laugh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wand of office is a maple staff.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when to pasture with his dogs hies he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leathern gaiters buttoned to the knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His forehead to an ample wisdom grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And air serene might be King David’s own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in his youth he led, as the tale tells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flocks at eve beside his father’s wells.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was the chief toward Lotus Farm who drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presently Mirèio’s self who knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flitting about the doorway. His heart bounded.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good Heaven!” he cried, “her praises they have sounded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nowise too loudly! Ne’er saw I such grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or high or low, in life or pictured face!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Only that face to see, his flock forsaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alari had come. Yet now his heart was quaking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, standing in the presence of the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Would you so gracious be, fair one,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“As to point out the way these hills to cross?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For else find I myself at utter loss.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, yes!” replied the girl, ingenuously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou takest the straight road, and comest thereby</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Pèiro-malo desert. Then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Follow the winding path till thou attain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A portico<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-37" id="noteref-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a> with an old tomb anear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two statues of great generals it doth bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><em>Antiquities</em> they call them hereabout.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thanks, many!” said the youth. “I had come out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand of my woolly tribe, or so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead into the mountains from La Crau.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We leave to-morrow. I their way direct,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sleeping-spots and feeding-ground select.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They bear my mark, and are of fine breed, all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for my shepherdess, when one I call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My own, the nightingales will ever sing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dared I hope you’d take my offering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirèio dear, no gems I’d tender you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But a carved box-wood cup⁠—mine own work too!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therewith he brought to light a goblet fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapped like some sacred relic with all care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carven of box-wood green. It was his pleasure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such things to fashion in his hours of leisure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, sitting rapt upon some wayside stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wrought divinely with a knife alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He carved him castanets with fingers light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that his flock would follow him at night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dark fields, obedient to their tones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the ringing collars, and the bones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That served for bell-tongues, he would cut with skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faces and figures, flowers and birds, at will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As for the goblet he was tendering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You would have said that no such fairy thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was ever wrought by shepherd’s knife or wit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A full-flowered poppy wreathed the rim of it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in among the languid flowers there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two chamois browsed, and these the handles were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A little lower down were maidens three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And certes they were marvellous to see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near by, beneath a tree, a shepherd-lad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slept, while on tiptoe stole the maidens glad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sought to seal his lips, ere he should waken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a grape-cluster from their basket taken.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet even now he smiles at their illusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the foremost maid is all confusion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The odour of the goblet proved it new:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The giver had not drunk therefrom; and you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had said, but for their woody colouring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The carven shapes were each a living thing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mirèio scanned the fair cup curiously.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A tempting offering thine, shepherd!” said she:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But suddenly, “A finer one than this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath my heart’s lord! Shepherd, his love it is!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine eyes close, his impassioned glances feeling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I falter with the rapture o’er me stealing!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, she vanished like a tricksy sprite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Alari turned, and in the gray twilight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruefully, carefully, he folded up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bore away again his carven cup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeming it sad and strange this winsome elf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her love should yield to any but himself.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon to the farm came suitor number two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A keeper of wild horses from Sambu<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a>⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veran, by name. About his island bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great prairies, where the asters flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He used to keep a hundred milk-white steeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who nipped the heads of all the lofty reeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A hundred steeds! Their long manes flowing free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the foam-crested billows of the sea!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wavy and thick and all unshorn were they;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the horses on their headlong way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plunged all together, their dishevelled hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed the white robes of creatures of the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say it to the shame of human kind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Camargan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a> steeds were never known to mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cruel spur more than the coaxing hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only a few or so, I understand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By treachery seduced, have halter worn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from their own salt prairies been borne;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet the day comes when, with a vicious start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their riders throwing, suddenly they part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And twenty leagues of land unresting scour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snuffing the wind, till Vacarès<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They find, the salt air breathe, and joy to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In freedom after ten years’ slavery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For these wild steeds are with the sea at home:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have they not still the colour of the foam?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance they brake from old King Neptune’s car;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the sea turns dark and moans afar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ships part their cables in the bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stallions of Camargue rejoicing neigh,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their sweeping tails like whipcord snapping loudly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or pawing the earth, all, fiercely and proudly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though their flanks were stung as with a rod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the sharp trident of the angry god,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who makes the rain a deluge, and the ocean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stirs to its depths in uttermost commotion.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And these were all Veran’s. Therefore one day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The island-chieftain paused upon his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across La Crau beside Mirèio’s door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she was famed, and shall be evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For beauty, all about the delta wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the great Rhône meeteth the ocean tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Confident came Veran to tell his passion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With paletot, in the Arlesian fashion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long, light, and backward from his shoulders flowing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His gay-hued girdle like a lizard glowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while his head an oil-skin cap protected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefrom the dazzling sun-rays were reflected.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And first the youth to Master Ramoun drew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good-morrow to you, and good fortune too!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said. “I come from the Camargan Rhône,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As keeper Pèire’s grandson I am known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou mindest him! For twenty years or more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My grandsire’s horses trod thy threshing-floor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Three dozen had the old man venerable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou, beyond a doubt, rememberest well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But would I, Master Ramoun, it were given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thee to see the increase of that leaven!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let ply the sickles! We the rest will do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now have we an hundred lacking two!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And long, my son,” the old man said, “pray I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you may see them feed and multiply.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I knew your grandsire well for no brief time;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now on him and me the hoary rime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of age descends, and by the home lamp’s ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We sit content, and no more visits pay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, Master Ramoun,” cried the youthful lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All that I want thou dost not yet discover!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For down at Sambu, in my island home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Crau folk for loads of litter come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we help cord them down, it happens so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We talk sometimes about the girls of Crau.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And thy Mirèio they have all portrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So charmingly, that, if thou wilt,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And if thou like me, I would gladly be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy son-in-law!” “God grant me this to see!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Ramoun. “The brave scion of my friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me and mine can only honour lend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did he fold his hands and them upraise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In saint-like gratitude. “And yet,” he says,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The child must like you too, O Veranet!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-41" id="noteref-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>The only one will alway be a pet!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile, in earnest of the dower I’ll give her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blessing of the saints be yours for ever!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forthwith summoned Ramoun his little daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told her of the friend who thus had sought her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale, trembling, and afraid, “O father dear!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She said, “is not thy wisdom halting here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I am but a child: thou dost forget.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely thou wouldst not send me from thee yet!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Slowly, so thou hast often said to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folk learn to love and live in harmony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one must know, and also must be known;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even then, my father, all’s not done!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here the dark shadow on her brow was lit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By some bright thought that e’en transfigured it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the drenched flowers, when morning rains are o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift up their heavy heads, and smile once more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<em>Mirèio’s mother held her daughter’s view.</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then blandly rose the keeper, “Adieu,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master,” he said: “who in Camargue hath dwelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knows the mosquito-sting as soon as felt.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Also that summer came to Lotus Place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One from Petite Camargue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> named Ourrias.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaker and brander of wild cattle, he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And black and furious all the cattle be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over those briny pastures wild who run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maddened by flood and fog and scalding sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alone this Ourrias had them all in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Summer and winter, where they roamed at large.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so, among the cattle born and grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their build, their cruel heart, became his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His the wild eye, dark colour, dogged look.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How often, throwing off his coat, he took</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His cudgel⁠—savage weaner!⁠—never blenching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And first the young calves from the udders wrenching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the wrathful mother fell so madly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cudgel after cudgel brake he gladly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till she, by his brute fury masterèd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild-eyed and lowing to the pine-copse fled!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft in the branding at Camargue had he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oxen and heifers, two-year-olds and three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seized by the horns and stretched upon the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His forehead bare the scar of an old wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fiery and forked like lightning. It was said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That once the green plain with his blood was red.</span>

			<p>
				<span>On a great branding-day befell this thing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aid the mighty herd in mustering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Li Santo, Agui Morto, Albaron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Faraman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a> a hundred horsemen strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had sent into the desert. And the herd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roused from its briny lairs, and, forward spurred</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By tridents of the branders close behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on the land like a destroying wind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heifers and bulls in headlong gallop borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plunged, crushing centaury and salicorne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the branding-booth at last they mustered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just where a crowd three hundred strong had clustered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A moment, as if scared, the beasts were still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when the cruel spur once more they feel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They start afresh, into a run they break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrice the circuit of the arena make;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As marterns fly a dog, or hawks afar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By eagles in the Luberon hunted are.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Ourrias⁠—what ne’er was done before⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaped from his horse beside the circus-door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the crowd. The cattle start again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All saving five young bulls, and scour the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But these, with flaming eyes and horns defying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaven itself, are through the arena flying.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he pursues them. As a mighty wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives on the clouds, he goads them from behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presently outstrips them in the race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thumps them with the cruel goad he sways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dances before them as infuriate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lets them feel his own fists’ heavy weight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The people clap and shout, while Ourrias</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White with Olympic dust encountered has</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One bull, and seized him by the horns at length;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now ’tis head to muzzle, strength for strength.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monster strains his prisoned horns to free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he bleeds, and bellows horribly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But vain his fury, useless all his trouble!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The neatherd had the art to turn and double</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And force the huge head with his shoulder round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shove it roughly back, till on the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Christian and beast together rolled, and made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A formless heap like some huge barricade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The tamarisks are shaken by the cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of “Bravo Ourrias! That’s done valiantly!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While five stout youths the bull pin to the sward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Ourrias, his triumph to record,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seizes the red-hot iron with eager hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vanquished monster on the hip to brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then came a troop of girls on milk-white ponies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arlesians⁠—flushed and panting every one is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As o’er the arena at full gallop borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They offer him a noble drinking-horn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brimful of wine; then turn and disappear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each followed by her faithful cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hero heeds them not. His mind is set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the four monsters to be branded yet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mower toils the harder for the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sees unmown. And so this Ourrias</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fought the more savagely as his foes warmed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And conquered in the end⁠—but not unharmed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>White-spotted and with horns magnificent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fourth beast grazed the green in all content.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now, man, enough!” in vain the neatherds shouted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couched is the trident and the caution flouted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With perspiration streaming, bosom bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ourrias the spotted bull charged then and there!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He meets his enemy, a blow delivers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full in the face; but ah! the trident shivers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beast becomes a demon with the wound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brander grasps his horns, is whirled around⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They start together, and are borne amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crushing the salicornes along the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The mounted herdsmen, on their long goads leaning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regard the mortal fray; for each is meaning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dire vengeance now. The man the brute would crush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brute bears off the man with furious rush;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while with heavy, frothy tongue he clears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood that to his hanging lip adheres.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The brute prevailed. The man fell dazed, and lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a vile rakeful in the monster’s way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sham dead!” went up a cry of agony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vain words! The beast his victim lifted high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On cruel horns and savage head inclined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flung him six and forty feet behind!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once more a deafening outcry filled the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook the tamarisks. But Ourrias</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell prone to earth, and ever after wore he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ugly scar that marred his brow so sorely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, mounted on his mare, he paces slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With goad erect to seek Mirèio.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It chanced the little maid was all alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She had, that morning, to the fountain gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here, with sleeves and petticoats uprolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And small feet dabbling in the water cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was her cheese-forms cleaning with shave-grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, lady saints! how beautiful she was!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Good-morrow, pretty maid!” began the wooer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thy forms will shine like mirrors, to be sure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will it offend thee, if I lead my mare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drink out of thy limpid streamlet there?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pray give her all thou wilt, at the dam head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ve water here to spare!” the maiden said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair one!” spake the wild youth, “if e’er thou come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As pilgrim or as bride to make thy home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Sylvarèal by the noisy wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No life of toil like this down here thou’lt have!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our fierce black cows are never milked, but these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roam all at large, and women sit at ease.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Young man, in cattle-land, I’ve heard them say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maids die of languor.”⁠—“Pretty maiden, nay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is no languor where two are together!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But brows are blistered in that burning weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bitter waters drunk.”⁠—“When the sun shines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lady, thou shalt sit beneath the pines!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! but they say, young man, those pines are laden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With coils of emerald serpents.”⁠—“Fairest maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ve herons also, and flamingoes red</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That chase them down the Rhône with wings outspread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like rosy scarfs.”⁠—“Then, I would have thee know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lotus and pine too far asunder grow!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But priests and maids, my beauty, ne’er can tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saw affirms, the land where they may dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eat their bread.”⁠—“Let mine but eaten be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With him I love: that were enough,” said she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To lure me from the home-nest to remove.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If that be so, sweet one, give me thy love!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thy suit,” Mirèio said, “mayhap I’ll grant!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But first, young man, yon water-lily plant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will bear a cluster of columbine grapes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon hills will melt from all their solid shapes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That goad will flower, and all the world will go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In boats unto the citadel of Baux!”</span>
