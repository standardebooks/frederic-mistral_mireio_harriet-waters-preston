			<p>
				<span>Cool with the coming eve the wind was blowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadows of the poplars longer growing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet still the westering sun was two hours high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the tired ploughman noted wistfully⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two hours of toil ere the fresh twilight come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wifely greeting by the door at home.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Ourrias the brander left the spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The insult he had suffered pondering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So moved to wrath was he, so stung with shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood into his very forehead came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, muttering deadly spite beneath his teeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drave at headlong gallop o’er the heath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As damsons in a bush, the stones of Crau</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are plentiful; and Ourrias, fuming so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would gladly with the senseless flints have striven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or through the sun itself his lance have driven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wild boar from its lair forced to decamp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scour the desert slopes of black Oulympe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ere turning on the dogs upon his track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Erects the rugged bristles of his back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whets his tusks upon the mountain oaks.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now young Vincen with his comely looks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must needs have chosen the herdsman’s very path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meets him squarely, boiling o’er with wrath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereas the simple dreamer wandered smiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His memory with a sweet tale beguiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he had heard a fond girl whispering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a mulberry-tree one morn in spring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight is he as a cane from the Durance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And love, peace, joy, beam from his countenance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The soft air swells his loose, unbottoned shirt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His firm, bare feet are by the stones unhurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And light as lizard slips he o’er the way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh! many a time, when eve was cool and gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the land in shadow lay concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He used to roam about the darkling field,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where the chill airs had shut the tender clover;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, like a butterfly, descend and hover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around the homestead of Mirèio;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, hidden cleverly, his hiding show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a gold-crested or an ivy wren,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a soft chirrup uttered now and then.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she would know who called her, and would fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift, silent, to the mulberry-tree hard by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With quickened pulses. Fair is the moonlight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon narcissus-buds in summer night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet the rustle of the zephyr borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In summer eve over the ripening corn,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until the whole, in infinite undulation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seems like a great heart palpitant with passion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also the chamois hath a joy most keen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When through the Queiras, that most wild ravine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All day before the huntsman he hath flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stands at length upon a peak, alone</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With larches and with ice fields, looking forth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all these joys and charms are little worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the brief rapture of the hours compared⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, brief!⁠—that Vincen and Mirèio shared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, by the friendly shadows favourèd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Speak low, my lips, for trees can hear, ’tis said,)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their hands would seek each other and would meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And silence fall upon them, while their feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Played idly with the pebbles in their way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, not knowing better what to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tyro-lover laughingly would tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the small mishaps that him befell;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of nights he passed beneath the open heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of bites the farmers’ dogs his legs had given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And show his scars. And then the maid told o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her tasks of that day and the day before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what her parents said; and how the goat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With trellis-flowers had filled his greedy throat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once only⁠—Vincen knew not what he did;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, stealthy as a wild-cat, he had slid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the grasses of the barren moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prostrate lay his darling’s feet before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then⁠—soft, my lips, because the trees can hear⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said, “Give me one kiss, Mirèio dear!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I cannot eat nor drink,” he made his moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For the great love I bear you! Yea, mine own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your breath the life out of my blood has taken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go not, Mirèio! Leave me not forsaken!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From dawn to dawn, at least, let a true lover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kneel, and your garment’s hem with kisses cover!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why, Vincen,” said Mirèio, “that were sin!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would the black-cap and the penduline</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell everywhere the secret they had heard!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No fear of that! for every tell-tale bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d banish from La Crau to Arles,” said he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For you, Mirèio, are as heaven to me!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now list! There grows a plant in river Rhône,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eel-grass, the name whereby that plant is known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two flowers it beareth, each on its own stem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a great space of water severs them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the plant springs out of the river’s bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the time for wooing comes,” he said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One flower leaps to the surface of the flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the genial sunshine opes its bud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon the other, seeing this so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swims eagerly to seize and kiss her there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, for the tangled weeds, can she not gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her love, till her frail stem breaks with the strain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now free at last, but dying, she doth raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her pale lips for her sister’s last embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So I! One kiss, and I will die to-night!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We are all alone!” Mirèio’s cheek grew white.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then sprang he, wild-eyed as a lissome beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clasped her. Hurriedly the maid released</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Herself from his too daring touch. Once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He strove to seize⁠—but ah! my lips, speak lower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the trees hear⁠—“Give over!” cried the girl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her slender frame did writhe and curl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet would he frantic cling; but straight thereafter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She pinched him, bent, slipped, and, with ringing laughter,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The saucy little damsel sped away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifted up her voice in mocking lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So did these two, upon the twilight wold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their moon-wheat sow, after the proverb old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowery the moments were, and fleet with pleasure:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of such our Lord giveth abundant measure</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To peasants and to kings alike. And so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I come to what befell that eve on Crau.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ourrias and Vincen met. As lightning cleaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The first tall tree, Ourrias his wrath relieves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis you son of a hag, for aught I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who have bewitched her⁠—this Mirèio;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And since your path would seem to lie her way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell her, tatterdemalion, what I say!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more for her nor for her weasel face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Care I than for the ancient clout,” he says,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That from your shoulders fluttering I see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go, pretty coxcomb, tell her this from me!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stopped Vincen thunderstruck. His wrath leaped high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As leaps a fiery rocket to the sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is it your pleasure that I strangle you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Base churl,” he said, “or double you in two?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And faced him with a look he well might dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when a starving leopard turns her head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His face was purple, quivered all his frame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh, better try!” the mocking answer came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“You’ll roll headfirst upon the gravel, neighbour!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bah, puny hands! meet for no better labour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to twist osiers when they’re supple made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to rob hen-roosts, lurking in the shade!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stung by the insult, “Yea, I can twist osier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I can twist your neck with all composure,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Vincen. “Coward, it were well you ran!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else vow I by <abbr>St.</abbr> James the Gallican,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ll never see your tamarisks any more!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This iron first shall bray your limbs before!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wondering, and charmed to find by such quick chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man whereon to wreak his vengeance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wait!” said the herdsman: “be not over-hot!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First let me have a pipe, young idiot!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought to light a buckskin pouch, and set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between his teeth a broken calumet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then scornfully, “While rocking you, my lamb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the goose-foot, did your gypsy-dam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne’er tell the tale of Jan de l’Ours, I pray?⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two men in one, who, having gone one day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By orders, to plough stubble with two yoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seized plough and teams, as shepherds do a crook,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And hurled them o’er a poplar-tree hard by?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well for you, urchin, there’s no poplar nigh!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You couldn’t lead a stray ass whence it came!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vincen stood like pointer to the game.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I say,” he roared in tones stentorian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will you come down, or must I fetch you, man</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or hog? Come! Brag no more your beast astride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You flinch now we are going to decide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which sucked the better milk, or you or I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it you, bearded scoundrel? We will try!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, I will tread you like a sheaf of wheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If you dare flout yon maiden true and sweet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No fairer flower in this land blossomed ever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I who am called Vincen, basket-weaver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes, I⁠—her suitor, be it understood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will wash your slanders out in your own blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If such you have!” Quoth Qurrias, “I am ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My gypsy-suitor to a cupboard! Steady!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therewith alights. They fling their coats away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fists fly, and pebbles roll before the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fall upon each other in the manner</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of two young bulls who, in the vast savannah,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the great sun glares in the tropic sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sleek sides of a dark young heifer spy</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the tall grasses, lowing amorous.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thunder bursts within them, challenged thus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mad, blind with love, they paw, they stare, they spring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And furious charge, their muzzles lowering;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Retire, and charge again. The ominous sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of crashing horns fills all the spaces round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And long, I ween, the battle is, and dire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The combatants are maddened by desire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puissant Love urges and goads them on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So here, with either doughty champion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas Ourrias who received the first hard touch;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, being threatened with another such,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lifts his huge fist and lays young Vincen flat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As with a club. “There, urchin, parry that!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“See if I have a scratch, man!” cried the lad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The other, “Bastard, count the knocks you’ve had!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Count you the ounces of hot blood,” he shouted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Monster, that from your flattened nose have spouted!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then they grapple; bend and stretch their best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With foot to foot, shoulder to shoulder, prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their arms are wreathed and coiled like serpents fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The veins within their necks to bursting swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tense their muscles with the mighty strain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long time they stiff and motionless remain,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With pulsing flanks, like flap of bustard’s wing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, one against the other steadying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear up like the abutments huge and wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that great bridge the Gardoun doth bestride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon they part: their doubled fists upraise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once more the pestle in the mortar brays,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in their fury ply they tooth or nail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good God! the blows of Vincen fall like hail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet ah! what club-like hits the herdsman deals!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as their crushing weight the weaver feels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He whirls as whirls a sling about his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And backward bends to deal his fiercest blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Look your last, villain!” Ere the word said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty herdsman seized him bodily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flung him o’er his shoulder far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a Provençal shovels wheat. He lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A moment on his side, not sorely hurt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pick up, O worm!” cried Ourrias⁠—“pick the dirt</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You have displaced, and eat it, if you will!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Enough of that! Brute who was broken ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll have three rounds before this game is over!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bitter hate retorts the poor boy-lover;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, reddening to his very hair for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rears like a dragon to retrieve his fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, daring death, he on the brute hath flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dealt a blow marvellous in such an one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight from the shoulder to the other’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who reeled and groped for that whereon to rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With darkening eyes and brow cold-beaded, till</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He crashed to earth, and all La Crau was still.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Its misty limit blent with the far sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea’s with the blue ether, dreamily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still in mid-air there floated shining things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swans, and flamingoes on their rosy wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to salute the last of the sunset</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the desert meres that glimmered yet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The white mare of the herdsman lazily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulled at the dwarf-oak leaves that grew thereby:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The iron stirrups of the creature jangled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As loose and heavy at her sides they dangled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stir, and I crush you, ruffian!” Vincen said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis not by feet that men are measurèd!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in the silent wold the victor pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heel upon the brander’s prostrate breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who writhed beneath it vainly, while the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sluggish and dark from lips and nostrils flowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice did he strive the horny foot to move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrice the basket-weaver from above</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dealt him a blow that levelled him once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he haggard lay, and gasping sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like some sea-monster. “So your mother, then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not, it seems, the only mould of men,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Vincen, jeeringly. “Go tell the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my fist’s weight to bulls in Sylvarèal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Go to the waste of the Camargan isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hide your bruises and your shame awhile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among your beasts!” So saying, he loosed his hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As some great ram, a shearer in the fold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pins with his knees till shorn; then, with a blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the crupper, bids him freely go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bursting with rage and all defiled with dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The herdsman went his ways. But wherefore must</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He linger ferreting about the heath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the oaks and broom, under his breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Muttering curses? until suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He stoops, then swings his savage trident high,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And darts on Vincen. For him all is done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vain were the hope that murderous lance to shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the boy paled as on the day he died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not fearing death, but that he could not bide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The treachery. A felon’s prey to be!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stung the manly soul to agony.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Traitor, you dare not!” But the lad restrains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The word, firm as a martyr in his pains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For yon’s the farmstead hidden by the trees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tenderly, wistfully, he turns to these.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O my Mirèio!” said the eager eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Look hither, darling⁠—’tis for you I die!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Great heart, intent as ever on his love!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Say your prayers!” thundered Ourrias from above</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a hoarse voice, and pitiless to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pierced the victim with his iron spear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, with a heavy groan, the fated lover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the green-sward rolled, and all was over.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beaten grass is dark with human gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the field-ants already coursing o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prostrate limbs ere Ourrias mounts, and hies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the rising moon in frantic wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Muttering, as the flints beneath him fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To-night the Crau wolves will feast merrily.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deep stillness reigned in Crau. Its limit dim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blent with the sea’s on the horizon’s rim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea’s with the blue ether. Gleaming things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swans, and flamingoes on their ruddy wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to salute the last declining light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the desert meres that glimmered white.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Away, Ourrias, away! Draw not the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urge thy unresting gallop o’er the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the green heron shout their fearsome cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy mare’s ear, as the good creature flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till her ear trembles, and her nostrils quiver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eyes dilate. That night the great Rhône River</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Slept on his stony bed beneath the moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As pilgrim of Sainte Baume may lay him down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fevered and weary, in a deep ravine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ho!” cries the ruffian to three boatmen seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ho! Boat ahoy! We must cross, hark ye there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On board or in the hold, I and my mare!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On board, my hearty, then, without delay!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There shines the night-lamp! And lured by its ray,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered a cheery voice, “about our prow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oars the fish frisk playfully enow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is good fishing, and the hour is fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On board at once! We have no time to spare.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Therewith upon the poop the villain clomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, tethered to the stern, amid the foam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swam the white mare. Now fishes huge and scaly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forsook their grottoes, and leaped upward gayly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flashed on the smooth surface of the stream.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have a care, pilot! For this craft I deem</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nowise too sound.” And he who spake once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay foot to stretcher, bent the supple oar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So I perceive. Ah!” was the pilot’s word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I tell thee we’ve an evil freight on board.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more. And all the while the vessel old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Staggered and pitched and like a drunkard rolled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A crazy craft! Rotten its timbers all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thunder of God!” Ourrias began to call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seizing the helm his tottering feet to stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon the boat in some mysterious way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed moved to writhing, as a wounded snake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose back a shepherd with a stone doth break.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Doth all this tumult, comrades, bode disaster?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appealed the brander, growing pale as plaster.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And will you drown me?” Brake the pilot out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I cannot hold the craft! She springs about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wriggles like a carp. Villain, I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ve murdered some one, and not long ago!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who told you that? May Satan if I have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrust me with his pitch-fork beneath the wave.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah!” said the livid pilot, “then I err!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had forgot the cause of all this stir.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis Saint Medard’s to-night, when poor drowned men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come from their dismal pits to land again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How deep and dark soe’er their watery prison.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look! Even now hath from the wave arisen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long procession of the weeping dead!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Barefoot, poor things! the shingly shore they tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The turbid water dripping, dripping, see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From matted hair and stained clothes heavily.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See them defile under the poplars tall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carrying lighted tapers, one and all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While up the river’s bank, now and anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eagerly clambereth another one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis they who toss our wretched craft about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So like a raging storm, I make no doubt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Their cramped legs and their mottled arms⁠—ah, see!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heavy heads they from the weeds would free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, how they watch the stars as on they go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quaff the fresh air and thrill at sight of Crau,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scent the harvest odours the winds bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their brief hour of motion revelling!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And still the water from their garments raineth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still another and another gaineth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The river-bank. And there,” the boatman moans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are the old men, women, and little ones:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They spurn the clinging mud. Ah me!” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yon ghastly things abhor the fisher’s trade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The lamprey and the perch they made their game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now are they become food for the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But what is this? Another piteous band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travelling in a line along the sand?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, yes! the poor deserted maids,” quoth he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who asked the Rhône for hospitality,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And sought to hide their shame in the great river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! alas! They seem to moan for ever.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, oh, how painfully, fond hearts, ill fated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Labour the bosoms by the dank weeds weighted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it the water dripping that one hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their long veils of hair, or is it tears?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ceased. The wending souls bare each a light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intently following in the silent night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The river-shore. And those two listening</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might even have heard the whirr of a moth’s wing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are they not, pilot,” asked the awe-struck brander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Seeking somewhat in the gloom where they wander?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah, yes, poor things!” the master-boatman said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“See how from side to side is turned each head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis their good works they seek⁠—their acts of faith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sown upon earth ere their untimely death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they spy the same, ’tis said moreover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They haste thereto, as haste the sheep to clover,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The good work or the act of faith to cull.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when of such as these their hands are full,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, they all turn to flowers! And they who gather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go tender them with joy to God the Father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being by the flowers to Peter’s gate conveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus those who find a watery grave,” he said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The gracious God granteth a respite to,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may save themselves. But some anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the day dawn will bury their good deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep underneath the surging river-weeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some,” the pilot whispered⁠—“some are worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Devourers of the needy, <em>murderers</em>,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Atheists, traitors, that worm-eaten kind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These hunt the river-shore, but only find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sins and crimes like great stones in the gravel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon their bare feet stumble as they travel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mule when dead is beaten never more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But these God’s mercy shall in vain implore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Under the roaring wave.” Here, sore afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ourrias a hand upon the pilot laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like robber at a turning. “Look!” he cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There’s water in the hold!” Whereon replies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pilot, coolly, “And the bucket’s there!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The herdsman bales for life in his despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ay, bale, brave Ourrias! But there danced that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Trincataio bridge, the water-sprite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Madly the white mare strove to break her halter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What ails you, Blanco?” Ourrias ’gan falter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fear you the dead yonder upon the verge?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the gunnel plashed the rising surge.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Captain, the craft sinks, and I cannot swim!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I know no help,” the pilot answered him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We must go down. But, presently,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A cable will be heaved us by the dead⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dead you fear so⁠—on the river-bank.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even as he spake the vessel sank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The tapers gleaming far and fitfully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the poor ghostly hands flared forth so high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sent a shaft of vivid brilliance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the murky river’s broad expanse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, as a spider in the morn you see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glide o’er his late-spun thread, the boatmen three,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Being all spirits, leaped out of the stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And caught and swooped along the dazzling beam.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Ourrias, too, the cable sought to seize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the gurgling waters, even as these;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sought it vainly. And the water-sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced upon Trincataio bridge that night.</span>
