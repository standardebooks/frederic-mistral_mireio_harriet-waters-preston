				<span>“The cross was looming yet, Mirèio,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aloft on the Judæan mount of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wet with the blood of God; and all the time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed crying to the city of the crime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What hast thou done, thou lost and slumbering⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What hast thou done, I say, with Bethlehem’s King?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The angry clamours of the streets were stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cedron alone a low lamenting made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afar; and Jordan rolled a gloomy tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasting into the desert, there to hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The overflowings of his grief and rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Mid terebinth and lentisk foliage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And all the poorer folk were heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing it was the Christ who had departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First having opened his own prison-door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On friends and followers to look once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sacred keys unto St. Peter given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like an eagle, soared away to heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh! then in Jewry woe and weeping were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the fair Galilean carpenter⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him who His honeyed parables distilled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over their hearts, and fainting thousands filled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the hillsides with unleavened bread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And healed the leper and revived the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But scribes and kings and priests, and all the horde</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sacrilegious vendors whom the Lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had driven from his house, their hatred uttered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘And who the people will restrain,’ they muttered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Unless in all the region round about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glory of this cross be soon put out?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So raged they, and the martyrs testified:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stephen the first was stoned until he died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>James with the sword was slain, and many a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cruelly crushed beneath a weight of stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, dying, all bear record undismayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Christ Jesus is the Son of God!’ they said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then us, brothers and sisters of the slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who him had followed in a loving train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They thrust into a crazy bark; and we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oarless and sailless, drifted out to sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We women sorely wept, the men their eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anxiously lifted to the lowering skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Palaces, temples, olive-trees, we saw⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly, oh swiftly!⁠—from our gaze withdraw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All saving Carmel’s rugged crests, and those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as a wave on the horizon rose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When suddenly a sharp cry toward us drifted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We turned, and saw a maid with arms uplifted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Oh, take me with you!’ cried she in distress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Oh, take me in the bark, my mistresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With you! I, too, must die for Jesus’ sake!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was our handmaid Sarah thus who spake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up there in heaven, whither she is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shineth sweetly as an April dawn!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Seaward before the wind our vessel drave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then God a thought unto Salome gave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her veil upon the foamy deep she threw⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, wondrous faith!⁠—and on the water, blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And white commingling wildly, it sustained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maid until our fragile craft she gained,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To her as well the strong breeze lending aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now saw we in the hazy distance fade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hill-top by hill-top, our dear native land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea encompassed us on every hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a sharp home-sickness upon us fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pangs whereof he who hath felt may tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So must we say farewell, O sacred shore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O doomed Judæa, farewell evermore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy just are banished, thy God crucified!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth let serpents in thy halls abide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wandering lions, tawny, terrible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed on thy vines and dates. Farewell! farewell!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The gale had grown into a tempest now:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vessel fled before it. On the prow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Martial was kneeling, and Saturnius:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, in his mantle folded, Trophimus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged saint silently meditated;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Maximin the bishop near him waited.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“High on the main-deck Lazarus held his place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was an awful pallor on his face⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hues of the winding-sheet and of the grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seemed to face the anger of the wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Martha his sister to his side had crept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Magdalene behind them cowered and wept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The slender bark, pursued of demons thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contained, beside, Cléon, Eutropius,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marcellus, Joseph of Arimathea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sidonius. And sweet it was to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The psalms they sang on the blue waste of sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaned o’er the tholes. Te Deum, too, said we.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How rushed the boat the sparkling billows by!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E’en yet that sea seems present to the eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The breeze, careering, on the waters hurled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby the snowy spray was tossed and whirled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifted in light wreaths into the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That soared like souls aloft, and vanished there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Out of the waves at morning rose the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set therein when his day’s course was run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mere waifs were we upon the briny plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sport of all the winds that scour the main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet of our God withheld from all mischance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we might bear His gospel to Provence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“At last there came a morning still and bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We noted how, with lamp in hand, the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most like an anxious widow from us fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Risen betimes to turn her household bread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within the oven. Ocean seemed as napping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The languid waves the boatside barely tapping.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Till a dull, bellowing noise assailed the ear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unknown before, it chilled our blood to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And next we marked a strange, upheaving motion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the utmost limit of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, stricken speechless by the gathering roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Helplessly gazed the troubled waters o’er.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then saw we all the deep with horror lower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the swift squall descended in its power;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves drop dead still⁠—’twas a portent fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bark hang motionless, as by a spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entranced; and far away, against the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mountain of black water seemed to rise,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And all the heaped-up sea, with vapour crested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To burst upon our vessel, thus arrested.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God, ’twas an awful hour! One monster wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed thrusting us into a watery grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fainting to death. Or ever it closed o’er us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The next upon a dizzy height upbore us.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The lightning cleft the gloom with blades of fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peal followed peal of thunder, deafening, dire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was as if all hell had been unchained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon our tiny craft, which groaned and strained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So hunted, and seemed rushing on her wreck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And smote our foreheads with her heaving deck.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now rode we on the shoulders of the main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now sank into its inky gulfs again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the seal dwelleth and the mighty shark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sea-peacock; and we seemed to hark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sad cry, lifted unceasingly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the unresting victims of the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A great wave brake above us, and hope died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lazarus prayed: ‘O Lord, be thou our guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who me ere now out of the tomb didst bring!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Succour the bark, for she is foundering!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a wood-pigeon’s wing, this outcry clove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tempest, and went up to realms above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And Jesus, looking from the palace fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he sat throned, beheld his friend’s despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fierce deep yawning to swallow him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway the Master’s gentle eyes grew dim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heart yearned over us with pity warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one long sun-ray leaped athwart the storm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now God be praised! For, though we yet were tost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right roughly up and down, and sank almost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With bitter sea-sickness, our fears were stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The haughty waves began to be allayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clouds brake afar, then vanished altogether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a green shore gleamed through the bright’ning weather.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Long was it yet ere the shocks quite subsided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the tempestuous waves; and our boat glided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our crazy boat, nearer that welcome shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All tranquilly, a dying breeze before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smooth as a grebe our keel the breakers clomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furrowing into great flakes the snowy foam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Until⁠—once more all glory be to God!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a rockless beach we safely trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knelt on the wet sand, and cried, ‘O Thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who saved from sword and tempest, hear our vow!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each one of us is an evangelist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy law to preach. We swear it, O Lord Christ!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“At that great name, that cry till then unheard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noble Provence, wert thou not deeply stirred?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy woods and fields, in all their fair extent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrilled with the rapture of a sweet content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a dog scents his master’s coming feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flies with bounding welcome him to meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou, Heavenly Father, also didst provide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A feast of shell-fish, stranded by the tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stay our hunger; and, to quench our thirst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Madest among the salicornes outburst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The same clear, healing spring, which flows alway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inside the church where sleeps our dust to-day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Glowing with zeal, we track the shingly Rhone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From moor to moor. In faith we travel on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until right gladly we discern the traces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of human husbandry in those wild places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soon, afar, the tall Arlesian towers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowned by the standard of the emperors.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To-day, fair Arles, a harvester thou seemest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sleepest on thy threshing-floor, and dreamest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glories past; but a queen wert thou then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mother of so brave sea-faring men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noisy winds themselves aye lost their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great harbour where thy shipping lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rome had arrayed thee in white marble newly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As an imperial princess decked thee duly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy brow a crown of stately columns wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gates of thy arena were sixscore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hadst thy theatre and hippodrome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So to make mirth in thy resplendent home!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We pass within the gates. A crowd advances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the theatre, with songs and dances.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We join them; and the eager thousands press</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the cool colonnades of palaces;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou, mayhap, a mighty flood hast seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rush through a maple-shaded, deep ravine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Arrived⁠—oh, shame and sorrow!⁠—we saw there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the proscenium, with bosoms bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young maidens waltzing to a languid lyre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And high refrain sung by a shrill-voiced choir.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They in the mazes of their dance surrounded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A marble shape, whose name like ‘Venus’ sounded.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The frenzied populace its clamour adds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the cries of lasses and of lads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who shout their idol’s praises o’er and o’er⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Hail to the Venus, of joy the bestower!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail to thee, Venus, goddess of all grace!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother of earth and of the Arlesian race!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The statue, myrtle-crowned, with nostrils wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And head high-borne, appears to swell with pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the incense-clouds; when suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In horror of so great audacity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaps Trophimus amid the maddened wretches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the bewildered throng his arms outstretches.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘People of Arles!’ in mighty tones he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Hear me, even for the sake of Christ who died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more.’ But, smitten by his shaggy frown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The idol groaned and staggered, and fell down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Headlong, from off its marble pedestal.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell, too, the awe-struck dancers, one and all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Therewith went up, as ’twere, a single howl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Choked were the gateways with a rabble foul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who filled all Arles with terror and dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that patricians tore their crowns away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the enragèd youth closed round us there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While flashed a thousand poniards in the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet they recoiled;⁠—whether it were the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of us, in our salt-crusted robes bedight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Trophimus’ calm brow which beamed on them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wreathed with a celestial diadem;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or tear-veiled Magdalene, who stood between us⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How tenfold fairer than their sculptured Venus!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And the old saint resumed: ‘Arlesian men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear ye my message first; and slay me then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If need be. Ye have seen your goddess famed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shiver like glass when my God was but named:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deem not, Arlesians, that the thing was wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By my poor, feeble voice; for we are naught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘The God who thus your idol smote, but now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No lofty temple hath on the hill’s brow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Day and Night see him alone up there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stern to sin, but generous to prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is he; and he hath made, with his own hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sky, the sea, the mountains, and the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘One day he saw, from his high dwelling-place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All his good things devoured by vermin base;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaves who drank hatred with their tears, and had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No comforter; and Evil, priestly clad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At altars keeping school; and, in the street,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maids who ran out the libertines to meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Wherefore, to purge this vileness, and to end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man’s torment and our pilloried race befriend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sent his own Son out of heaven down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naked and poor, wearing no golden crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He came, was of a virgin born, and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The daylight first pillowed on stable-straw.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘People of Arles, turn to this lowly One.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ourselves can show the wonders he hath done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who were his comrades; and, in that far land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where rolls the yellow Jordan, saw him stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his white linen robe, amid the crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who him assailed with maledictions loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Full gentle was his message: for he showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men should love each other, and that God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is both almighty and all merciful;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that the kingdom where he beareth rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descendeth not to tyrants, cheats, and scorners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to the poor, the lowly, and the mourners.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘These were his teachings: and he them attested</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By walking on the waters; and arrested</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sickness most bitter by a glance, a word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dead, by yon grim rampart undeterred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came back to earth. This Lazarus whom you see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once rotted in the grave. But jealousy</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Inflamed the bad hearts of the Jewish kings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They led him to a mountain for these things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cruelly unto a tree trunk nailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spat on the sacred face, and coarsely railed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifted him on high.’ Here all the throng</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake into loud lament and sobbing strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Mercy,’ they cried, ‘for our iniquities!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What shall we do the Father to appease?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answer us, man of God! If blood must flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shall have hecatombs.’⁠—‘Ah, no! ah, no!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Replied the saint; ‘but slay before the Father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your vices and your evil passions rather!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So knelt, and prayed: ‘Lord, thou dost not desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Odour of slaying, sacrificial fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or stately temples! Dearer far to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the bread given to those who fainting be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sweet girl’s timid coming, who doth bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her pure heart, like a May-flower, to her king.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As o’er the Apostle’s lips, like sacred oil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The word of God was flowing, ’gan recoil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The idols everywhere, and plunged at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown the temple stairs; while tears dropped fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rich and poor and working-men all ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To kiss the garment of the holy man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then bare Sidonius witness. In his night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was born blind⁠—he led to the true light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The men of Arles. And Maximin, beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The resurrection of the Crucified</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set forth, and bade them turn from sin away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arles was baptized upon that very day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then the Lord’s breath did speed us in our going,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like wind upon a fire of shavings blowing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, as we turned of these to take farewell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came messengers, before our feet who fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And passionately cried, ‘O god-sent strangers!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear yet the story of our cruel dangers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘To our unhappy city came the sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of marvels wrought and oracles new found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sends us hither. We are dead who stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before you! Such a monster wastes our land!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A scourge of God, greedy of human gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It haunts our woods and gorges. We implore</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Your help. The monster hath a dragon’s tail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bristles its back with many a horrid scale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It hath six human feet, and fleet they are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lion’s jaw; eyes red like cinnabar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its prey it hideth in a cavern lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a rock that beetles o’er the Rhone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Now day by day our fishermen grow few</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fewer.’ Saying this, they wept anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bitterly⁠—the men of Tarascon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then maiden Martha said, serene and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Ready am I, and my heart yearns with pity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marcellus, haste: we two will save the city!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For the last time on earth we did embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hope of meeting in a happy place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And parted. Martial to Limoges him hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While fair Toulouse became Saturnius’ bride:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our Eutropius the new cause did plead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sow, in brave Orange, the blessèd seed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And thou, sweet virgin, whither goest thou?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With step unfaltering and untroubled brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Martha her cross and holy-water carried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the dragon dire, and never tarried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wild men clomb the pine-trees round about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fray to witness and the maiden’s rout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Startled from slumber in his darksome cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shouldst have seen the leap the monster gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet vainly writhed he ’neath the holy dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And growled and hissed as Martha near him drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound with a frail moss-halter, and forth led</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snorting. Then all the people worshippèd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Huntress Diana art thou?’ prostrate falling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the Christian maid, began they calling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Or yet Minerva, the all-wise and chaste?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Nay, nay!’ the damsel answered in all haste:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I am God’s handmaid only.’ And the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She taught until with her to Him they bowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then by the power of her young voice alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She smote Avignon’s rock; and from the stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Welled faith in so pellucid stream, that, later,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clements and Gregories in that fair water</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dipped holy chalices their thirst to slake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Rome long years did for her glory quake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And all Provence, regenerate, sang so clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hymn of praise, that God was glad to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou not marked, when rain begins to fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How spring the drooping trees and grasses all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How soon the foliage with joy will quiver?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fevered souls drank of this cooling river!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou fair Marseilles, who openest on the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy haughty eyes and gazest languidly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though naught else were worthy to behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, though the winds rage, dreamest but of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Lazarus preached to thee, thou didst begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those eyes to close, and see the night within,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And to the sources of that river speeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That aye the tears of Magdalene were feeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst wash thy sins away: and in this hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art proud once more; but other storms may lower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forget not, then, amid thy revelries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose tears they are that bathe thine olive-trees!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dark cedars that on Mount Sambuco grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sheer ledges of the hills of Aix, and you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tall pines, clothing the flanks of Esterel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And junipers of Trevaresso, tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How thrilled your vales with joy, when, his cross bearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bishop Maximin was through them faring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Seest thou one with white arms on her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who kneels and prays in yonder grotto, dressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the bright garment of her floating hair?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor sufferer! Her tender knees are bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cruelly by the sharp flints are torn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moon, with pale torch, watches the forlorn</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And sad recluse. The woods in silence bow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The angels hush their very heart-throbs now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As, gazing through a crevice, they espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pearly tear fall from the lifted eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And haste the precious gem to gather up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keep for ever in a golden cup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Enough, O Magdalene! Thirty years ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wind that in the forest whispers low</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare thee the pardon of the Man divine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tears that the rock weeps are tears of thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These, like a snowfall softly sprinkled o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall whiten woman’s love for ever more!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But naught can stay the mourner’s gnawing grief.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even the little birds bring not relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That flock around her, building many a nest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Saint Pilon; nor spirits of the blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lift and rock her in their arms of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soar, seven times a day, the vales above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O Lord, be thine the glory! And may we</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy full brightness and reality</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold thee ever! Poor and fugitive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We women did of thy great grace receive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We, even we, touched by thy love supernal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shed some faint reflex of the light eternal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye, Alpine peaks and all blue hills of Baux,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the latest hour of time will show</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The traces of our teaching carved in stone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so Death found us on the marshes lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep in Camargue, encircled by the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from our day’s long labour set us free.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And as, on earth, haste all things to decay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faded the memory of our tombs away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While sang Provence her songs, and time rolled on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, as Durance is blended with the Rhone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ended the merry kingdom of Provence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fell asleep upon the breast of France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘France, take thy sister by the hand!’ So saith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our land’s last king, he drawing near to death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘On the great work the future hath in store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together counsel take! Thou art the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong; she, the more fair: and rebel night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before your wedded glory shall take flight.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This did Renè. Therefore we sought the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As on his feathers he lay slumbering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed the spot where long our bones had lain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he, with bishops twelve and courtly train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came down into this waste of sand and waves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found, among the salicornes, our graves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Adieu, dear Mirèio! The hour flies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like a taper’s flame before it dies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We see life’s light within thy body flicker.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, ere the soul is loosed⁠—come quick, oh quicker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sisters!⁠—we the hills of heaven must scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ever she arrive within the veil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Roses and a white robe we must prepare!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is love’s martyr and a virgin fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dies to-day! With sweetest flowers blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Celestial paths! and on Mirèio</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine saintly splendours of the heavenly host!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”</span>
