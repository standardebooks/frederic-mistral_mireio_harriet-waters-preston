			<p>
				<span>As, when in orange-lands God’s day is ending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maids let fly the leafy boughs, and, lending</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A helpful hand, the laden baskets lift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On head or hip, and fishing-boats adrift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are drawn ashore, and, following the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden clouds evanish, one by one;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the full harmonies of eventide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swelling from hill and plain and river-side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the sinuous Argens⁠—airy notes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of pastoral pipe, love-songs, and bleat of goats⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grow fainter, and then wholly fade away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sombre night falls on the mountains gray;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or as the last sigh of an anthem soft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or dying organ-peal, is borne aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er some old church, and on the wandering wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Passes afar⁠—so passed the music twined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the three Maries’ voices, heavenward carried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her, she seemed asleep; for yet she tarried</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kneeling: and was more fair than ever now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strange a freak of sunlight crowned her brow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here they who had sought her through the wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The aged parents, came, and found their child;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet stayed their faltering steps the portal under,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gaze on her entranced with awe and wonder;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then crossed their foreheads with the holy water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, hasting o’er the sounding flags, besought her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wake. But, as a frighted vireo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who spies the huntsman, shrieked Mirèio,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O God, what is it? Father, mother, tell!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where will you go?” And therewith swooned and fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The weeping mother lifts her head, and yearns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over her. “My sweet, your forehead burns!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What means it?” And again, “No dream is this.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My own sweet child⁠—my very own it is⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low lying at my feet!” And then she wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laughed together; and old Ramoun crept</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beside them. “Little darling, it is I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your father, has your hand!” Then suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His anguish choked him, and he could but hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chafe and strive to warm those fingers cold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile the wind the mournful tidings bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abroad, and all Li Santo thronged the door,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And anxiously. “Bear the sick child,” they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Into the upper chapel, nor delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let her touch the dear Saints’ relics thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within their reliquaries marvellous;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or kiss, at least, with dying lips!” And there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two women raised, and bore her up the stair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In this fair church, altars and chapels three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built one upon the other, you may see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of solid stone. In that beneath the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dusky gypsies kneel, with awe profound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before Saint Sarah. One is over it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hath God’s altar. And one higher yet,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On pillars borne⁠—last of the sanctuaries⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The small, funereal chapel of the Maries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With heavenward vault. And here long years have lain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich legacy⁠—whence falleth grace like rain!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ever-blessed relics. Four great keys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enlock the cypress chests that shelter these.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once are they opened in each hundred years;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And happy, happy shall he be who nears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sees and touches them! Upon the wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright star and weather fair his bark shall have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His trees be with abundant fruitage graced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His faithful soul eternal blessing taste!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An oaken door, with carvings rich and rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gift of the pious people of Beaucaire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closes the holy precinct. And yet surely</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That which defends is not the portal purely⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not the circling rampart; but the grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descending from the azure depths of space.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So to the chapel bare they the sick child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While up the winding stair the folk defiled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as a white-robed priest threw wide the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They, entering, fell on the dusty floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As falls full-bearded barley when a squall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath smitten it, and worshipped one and all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O lovely Saints! O friendly Saints!” they said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Saints of God, pity this poor young maid!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pity her!” sobbed the mother. “I will bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she is well, so fair an offering!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My flower-carved cross, my golden ring!” she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And tell the tale through town and country-side!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O Saints,” groaned Ramoun, stumbling in the gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While shook his aged head, “be kind, and come!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look on this little one! She is my treasure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is my plover! Pretty beyond measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And good and meet for life! Send my old bones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dung the mallows, but save her!” he moans.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And all the while Mirèio lay in swoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a breeze, with declining afternoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blew from the tamarisks. Then, hoping still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To call her back to life, they raised with skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flower of Lotus Farm, and tenderly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid on the tiles that overlook the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There, from the doorway leading on the tiles⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chapel’s eye⁠—one’s vision roams for miles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the pallid limit of the brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blending and the separating line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between the clouds and waters to explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the great waves that roll for evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Insensate and unceasing and untiring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They follow one another on; expiring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sullen roar, amid the drifted sand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While vast savannas, on the other hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretch till they meet a heaven without a stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfathomed blue over unmeasured plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Only a light-green tamarisk, here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quivering in the faintest breath of air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a long belt of salicornes, appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With swans that dip them in the desert meres,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With oxen roaming the waste moor at large;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or swimming Vacares from marge to marge.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last the maiden murmured, but how weak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice how vague the words! “On either cheek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seem to feel a breeze⁠—one from the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One from the land: and this refreshes me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like morning airs; but that doth sore oppress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And burn me, and is full of bitterness.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So ceased. The people of Li Santo turn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blankly from plain to ocean: then discern</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lad who nears them, at so fleet a pace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dust in clouds is raised; and, in the race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outstripped, the tamarisks are growing small,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And far behind the runner seem to fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Vincen it was. Ah, poor unhappy youth!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Master Ambroi spake that sorry truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My son, the pretty little lotus-spray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not for you!” he turned, and fled away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Valabrègo like a bandit fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see her once again. And when they said</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In Crau, “She in Li Santo must be sought,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rhone, marshes, weary Crau, withheld him not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor stayed he ever in his frantic search</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, seeing that great throng inside the church,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rose on tiptoe deadly pale, and crying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where is she?” And they answered, “She is dying</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Above there in the chapel.” In despair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all distraught, he hurried up the stair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, when his eye fell on the prostrate one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw his hands wildly up. “What have I done⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What have I done against my God and hers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To call down on me such a heavy curse</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“From Heaven? Have I cut the throat of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who gave me birth? or at a church taper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lighted my pipe? or dared I, like the Jews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The holy crucifix ’mong thistles bruise?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is it, thou accursèd year of God⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why must I bear so terrible a load?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Twas not enough my darling they denied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me! They’ve hunted her to death!” he cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he knelt, and kissed her passionately;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the people, when they saw how greatly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heart was wrung, felt theirs too swell with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wept aloud above the stricken twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, as the sound of many waters, falling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far down a rocky valley, rises calling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the shepherd high the hills among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose from the church a sound of full-choired song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the temple trembled with the swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that sweet psalm the Santen sing so well:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:hymn">
				<p>
					<span>“Saints of God, ere now sea-faring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On these briny plains of ours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who have set a temple bearing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Massy walls and snowy towers,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Watch the wave-tossed seaman kindly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lend him aid the bark to guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Send him fair winds, lest he blindly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perish on the pathless tide!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“See the woman poor and sightless:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er a word she uttereth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark her days are and delightless⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Darkness aye is worse than death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Vain the spells they have told o’er her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blank is all her memory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Queens of Paradise, restore her!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touch those eyes that they may see!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“We who are but fishers lowly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lift our hearts ere forth we go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye, the helpful saints and holy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fill our nets to overflow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“So, when penitents heart-broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sue for pardon at your door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flood their souls with peace unspoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">White flowers of our briny moor!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<span>So prayed the Santen, with tears and strong crying.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the patrons to the maid low-lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And breathed a little life into her frame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that her wan eyes brightened, and there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tender flush of joy her visage over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the sweet sight of Vincen bent over her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why love, whence came you? Do you mind, I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A word you said down at the Farm one day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking under the trellis, by my side?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You said, ‘If ever any harm betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hie thee right quickly to the holy Saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who cure all ills and hearken all complaints.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dearest, I would you saw my heart this minute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in a glass, and all the comfort in it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comfort and peace like a full fountain welling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all my happy spirit! There’s no telling⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A grace beyond my uttermost desires!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look, Vincen: see you not God’s angel-choirs?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pausing, she gazed into the deep blue air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was as if she could discern up there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonderful things hidden from mortal men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soon her dreamy speech began again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, they are happy, happy souls that soar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aloft, tethered by flesh to earth no more!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Did you mark, Vincen dear, the flakes of light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fell when they began their heavenward flight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If all their words to me had written been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would have made a precious book, I ween.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Vincen, who had striven his tears to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake forth in sobs, and gave his anguish way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Would to God I <em>had</em> seen them ere they went!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, would to God! Then to their white raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a tick fastening, I would have cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O queens of heaven! Sole ark where we may bide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this late hour, do what you will with me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maimed, sightless, toothless, I would gladly be;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘But leave my pretty little fairy sane</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sound!’ ” Here brake Mirèio in again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There are they, in their linen robes of grace!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They come!” and from her mother’s fond embrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to struggle wildly to be free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waved her hand afar toward the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then all the folk turned also to the main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And under shading hands their eyes ’gan strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, save the pallid limit of the brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blending and the separating line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twixt wave and vault, they nothing could descry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Naught cometh,” said they. But the child, “Oh, ay!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Look closer! There’s a bark, without a sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wafted toward us by a gentle gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they are on it! And the swell subsides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before them, and the bark so softly glides!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear is the air and all the sea like glass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sea-birds do homage as they pass!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Poor child! she wanders,” murmured they; “for we</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See only the red sunset on the sea!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yet it is they! Mine eyes have told me true,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sick one panted?⁠—“ ’Tis the boat in view!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now low, now lifted, it is drawing near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, miracle of God!⁠—the boat is here!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now was she paling, as a marguerite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-blown and smitten by a tropic heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While crouching Vincen, horror in his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ere his well-belovèd quite depart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath her in charge unto our Lady given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Saints of the chapel and of heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lit are the tapers, and, in violet stole</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Begirt, the priest, to stay the passing soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays angel’s bread to those dry lips of hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the last unction so administers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then of her body the seven parts anoints</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holy oil, as holy church appoints.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hour was calm. Upon the tiles no word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save the <i xml:lang="la">oremus</i> of the priest was heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last red shaft of the declining day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck on the wall and passed, and heaven turned gray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea’s long waves came slowly up the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake with a murmur soft, and were no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beside the maid knelt father, mother, lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hoarsely sobbed at intervals above her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till once again her lips moved, and she spake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now is the parting close at hand! So take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My hand, and press it quickly, dears. Lo, now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glory grows on either Mary’s brow!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The pink flamingoes flock from the Rhone shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tamarisks in blossom all adore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dear Saints beckon me to them,” she said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“They tell me I need never be afraid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They know the constellations of the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bark will take us quick to Paradise!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My little pet,” said Ramoun, quite undone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“You will not go, and leave the home so lone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why have I felled my oaks with such ado?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The zeal that nerved me only came of you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the hot sun on sultry glebe o’ertook me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought of you, and heat and thirst forsook me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear father, if a moth shall sometime fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About your lamp at night, that will be I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But see! the Saints are standing on the prow!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They wait. I’m coming in a moment now!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slowly I move, good Saints, for I am ailing.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It is too much!” the mother brake out, wailing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh, stay with me! I cannot let you die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when you’re well, Mirèio, by and by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll go some day to Aunt Aurano’s, dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carry pomegranates. Do you hear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maiano is not distant from our home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in one day, one may both go and come.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not very distant, mother⁠—that I know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all alone thou wilt the journey go!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now give me my white raiment, mother mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, how the mantles of the Maries shine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sawest thou ever such a dazzling sight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snow upon the hillsides is less white!”</span>

				<span>“O thou,” cried the dark weaver, “who didst ope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace of thy love to me, my hope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My queen, my all! A blossoming alms thou gavest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mire of my low life in thine thou lavest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it shines like a mirror, and dost place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me in eternal honour by thy grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Pearl of Provence! of my young days the sun!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall it be ever said of such an one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw upon her forehead the death-dew?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall it be said, puissant Saints, of you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You looked unmoved upon her mortal pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Letting her clasp your sacred sill in vain?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Slowly the maiden answered, “My poor friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is it doth affright you, and offend?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believe me, dear, the thing that we call death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is a delusion. Lo! it vanisheth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a fog when the bells begin their pealing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As dreams with daylight through the window stealing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am not dying! See, I mount the boat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a light foot! And now we are afloat!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good-by! good-by! We are drifting out to sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves encompass us, and needs must be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The very avenue to Paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all around they touch the azure skies!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Gently they rock us now. And overhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many stars are shining! Ah,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Among those worlds one surely may be found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where two may love in peace! Hark, Saints, that sound!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it an organ played across the deep?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then sighed, and fell, as it had been, asleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, by her smiling lips, you might have guessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That yet she spake. Only the Santen pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the sleeper in a mournful band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, with a taper passed from hand to hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Signed the cross o’er her. While, as turned to stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The parents gazed on what themselves had done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To them her form is all enrayed with light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vainly they feel her cold, they see her white:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The awful stroke they comprehend not now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, soon as Vincen marked the level brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rigid arms, the sweet eyes wholly veiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“See you not she is dead?” he loudly wailed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Quite dead?” And therewith fiercely wrung his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he of old had wrung the osier-strands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And threw his naked arms abroad. “My own!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cried, “they will not weep for you alone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With yours, the trunk of my life too they fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Dead’ was I saying? ’Tis impossible:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A demon whispered me the word, no doubt!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, in God’s name, ye who stand about⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye who have seen dead women ere to-day⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If, passing through the gates, they smile that way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her look is well-nigh merry, do you see?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why do they turn their heads away from me,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And weep? This means, I think, that all is o’er.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her pretty prattle I shall hear no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still is the voice I loved!” All hearts were thrilled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears rushed like rain, and sobs would not be stilled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One sound went up of weeping and lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the waves on the beach returned the plaint.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So when in some great herd a heifer dies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the carcass where it starkly lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nine following eves the beasts take up their station,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seem to mourn after their speechless fashion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea, the plain, the winds, thereover blowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Echo nine days with melancholy lowing⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Poor Master Ambroi!” Vincen wandered on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou wilt weep heavy tears over thy son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now, good Santen, one last wish is mine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bury me with my love, below the brine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scoop in the oozy sand a crib for two:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears for so great a mourning will not do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And a stone wall about the basin set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the sea flow not in, and part us yet!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Santen, I trust you! Then, while they are beating</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their brows, and with remorse her name repeating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There at the farm where her home used to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far from the unrest of the upper sea,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Down in the peaceful blue we will abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My oh so pretty, alway side by side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you shall tell me of your Maries over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over, until with shells the great storms cover.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here the crazed weaver on the corse him threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the church arose the psalm anew.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span class="i2">“So, when penitents heart-broken</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">Sue for pardon at your door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Flood their souls with peace unspoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i3">White flowers of our briny moor!”</span>
