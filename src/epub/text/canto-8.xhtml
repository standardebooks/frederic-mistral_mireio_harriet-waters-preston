			<p>
				<span class="i5">The rage of the mighty lioness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">Who shall restrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She came to her den, and she found it bare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Moorish huntsman had entered there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The huntsman came, and the whelp is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away through the canebrake they have flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloping far at a headlong pace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i5">To follow⁠—vain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She roars awhile in her deep despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rises and courses, lank and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the hills of Barbary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a maid bereft of her love is she.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mirèio lay upon her little bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clasping in both her hands her burning head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dim was the chamber; for the stars alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the maid weep, and heard her piteous moan⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Help, Mother Mary, in my sore distress!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, cruel fate! Oh, father pitiless,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who tread me underfoot! Could you but see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My heart’s mad tumult, you would pity me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You used to call me darling long ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now you bend me to the yoke as though</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I were a vicious colt that you were fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break. Why does the sea not flood this plain?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I would the wealthy lands that make me weep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were hid for evermore in the great deep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, had I in a serpent’s hole been born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some poor vagrant, I were less forlorn!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For then if any lad, my Vincen even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had asked my hand, mayhap it had been given.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O Vincen, who so handsome are and true!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If only they would let me go to you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d cling as clings the tender ivy-vine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the oak: I would not ever pine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For food, but life in your caresses find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drink at wayside pools with happy mind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So on her pallet the sweet maid lay sobbing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire in her heart and every vein a-throbbing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the happy time remembering⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, calm and happy!⁠—of her love’s fair spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until a word in Vincen’s very tone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes to her memory. “ ’Twas you, my own⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Twas you,” she cried, “came one day to the farm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, ‘If ever thou dost come to harm⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any lizard, wolf, or poisonous snake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever should wound thee with its fang⁠—betake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thyself forthwith to the most holy Saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who cure all ills and hearken all complaints.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And sure I am in trouble now,” she said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Therefore we’ll go, and come back comforted.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then lightly from her white cot glided she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And straightway opened, with a shining key,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wardrobe where her own possessions lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was of walnut wood, and carven gay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here were her childhood’s little treasures all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here sacredly she kept the coronal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn at her first communion; and thereby</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A faded sprig of lavender and dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a wax taper almost burned, as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once blessed, the distant thunder to dispel.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A smart red petticoat she first prepares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which she herself had quilted into squares⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of needlework a very masterpiece;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And round her slender waist she fastens this;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over it another, finer one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She draws; and next doth a black bodice don,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And fasten firmly with a pin of gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her white shoulders, her long hair unrolled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Curling, and loose like a dark garment, lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, gathering up, she swiftly coils away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a cap of fine, transparent lace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then decks the veilèd tresses with all grace,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thrice with a ribbon blue encircling them⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair young brow’s Arlesian diadem.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lastly, she adds an apron to the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And folds a muslin kerchief o’er her breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her dire haste, alone, the child forgat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shallow-crowned, broad-brimmed Provençal hat,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That might have screened her from the mortal heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, so arrayed, crept forth on soundless feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown the wooden staircase, in her hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her shoes, undid the heavy door-bar, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her soul unto the watchful saints commended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As away like a wind of night she wended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was the hour when constellations keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their friendly watch o’er followers of the deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eye of <abbr>St.</abbr> John’s eagle flashed afar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As it alighted on a burning star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of the three where the evangelist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath his alternate dwelling. Cloud nor mist</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Defaced the dark serene of star-lit sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the great chariot of souls went by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On wingèd wheels along the heavenly road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing away from earth its blessed load.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far up the shining steeps of Paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circling hills behold it as it flies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mirèio hasted no less anxiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than Magalouno in the days gone by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who searched the wood with sad, inquiring glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her lost lover, Pèire of Provence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When cruel waves divorced him from her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left her lone and wretched. Soon espied</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The maid, upon the boundary of the lea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folds where her sire’s own shepherds could she see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Already milking. Some the sheep compelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the pen-side by the muzzle held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To suckle quietly their tawny lambs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always arose the bleat of certain dams;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While other childless ones the shepherds guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the milker. On a stone astride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mute as the very night, sits he, and dim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While, pressed from swollen udders, a long stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of warm fine milk into the pail goes leaping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The white froth high about its border creeping.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sheep-dogs all in tranquil slumber lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fine, large dogs⁠—as white as lilies they⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretched round the enclosure, muzzles deep in thyme.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peace was everywhere, and summer clime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er the balmy country, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brooded a heaven full of stars, and clear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in the stillness doth Mirèio dash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the hurdles, like a lightning flash,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifting a wailing cry that never varies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will none go with me to the holy Maries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the shepherds?” They and the sheep hear it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see the maiden flitting like a spirit,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And huddle up, and bow their heads, as though</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smit by a sudden gale. The farm-dogs know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her voice, but never stir her flight to stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now is she already far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threads the dwarf-oaks, and like a partridge rushes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the holly and the camphyre bushes,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her feet scarce touching earth. And now she passes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Curlews in flocks asleep amid the grasses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the oaks, who, roused from slumber soft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arise in haste, and wing their flight aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the sad and barren plain; and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together “Cour’li! cour’li! cour’li!” call,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until the Dawn, with her dew-glittering tresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From mountain-top to level slow progresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweetly saluted by the tufted lark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soaring and singing o’er the caverns dark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great hills, whose pinnacles each one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appear to sway before the rising sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then was revealed La Crau, the bare, the waste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rough with stones, the ancient, and the vast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose proud old giants, if the tale be true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once dreamed, poor fools, the Almighty to subdue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With but a ladder and their shoulders brave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But He them ’whelmed in a destroying wave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already had the rebels dispossest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Mount of Victory of his tall crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted with lever from its place; and sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would have helped it high upon Ventour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they had piled the rugged escarpment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They from the Alpine range had earlier rent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But God his hand extended o’er the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The north-west wind, thunder, and hurricane</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loosed; and these arose like eagles three</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From mountain clefts and caverns and the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapped in thick fog, with fury terrible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the marble pile together fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then were the rude Colossi overthrown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a dense covering of pudding-stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread o’er La Crau, the desolate, the vast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mute, the bare to every stormy blast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wears the hideous garment to this day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile Mirèio farther speeds away</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the home-lands, while the sun’s ardent glare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes visible all round the shimmering air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrill cicalas, grilling in the grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat madly evermore their tiny brass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor tree for shade was there, nor any beast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The many flocks, that in the winter feast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the short, savoury grasses of the moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had climbed the Alps, where airs are cool and pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pastures fadeless. Yet the maid doth fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the pouring fire of a June sky⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly, fly, like lightning. Lizards large and gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peep from their holes, and to each other say,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She must be mad who thus the shingle clears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a heat that sets the junipers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A-dancing on the hills; on Crau, the sands.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The praying mantes lift beseeching hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Return, return, O pilgrim!” murmuring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For God hath opened many a crystal spring;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And shady trees hath planted, so the rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save upon your cheeks. Why, then, expose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your brow to the unpitying summer heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vainly as well the butterflies entreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her the wings of love, the wind of faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear on together, as the tempest’s breath</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>White gulls astray over the briny plains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Agui-Morto. Utter sadness reigns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In scattered sheep-cots of their tenants left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overrun with salicorne. Bereft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hot desert, seemed the maid to wake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see nor spring nor pool her thirst to slake,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And slightly shuddered. “Great <abbr>St.</abbr> Gent!” she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O hermit of the Bausset mountain-side!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O fair young labourer, who to thy plough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst harness the fierce mountain-wolf ere now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the flinty rock, recluse divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst open springs of water and of wine,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And so revive thy mother, perishing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heat! like me, when they were slumbering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst forsake thy household, and didst fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone with God through mountain-passes, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy mother found thee! For me, too, dear Saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open a spring; for I am very faint,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And my feet by the hot stones blisterèd!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, in high heaven, heard what Mirèio said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The good <abbr>St.</abbr> Gent: and soon she doth discover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A well far off, with a bright stone laid over;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, like a marten through a shower of rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speeds through the flaming sun-rays, this to gain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The well was old, with ivy overrun⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A watering-place for flocks; and from the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce by it sheltered sat a little boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With basket-full of small white snails for toy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his brown hands, he one by one withdrew them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tiny harvest-snails; and then sang to them⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i4">“Snaily, snaily, little nun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Come out of the cell, come into the sun!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Show me your horns without delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or I’ll tear your convent-walls away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the fair maid of Crau, when she had dipped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her burning lips into the pail, and sipped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly upraised a lovely, rosy face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, “Little one! what dost thou here?” she says.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A pause. “Pick snailies from the stones and grass?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou hast guessed right!” the urchin’s answer was.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Here in my basket have I⁠—see, how many!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nuns, harvest-snails, and these, as good as any!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And thou dost eat them”⁠—“Nay, not I,” replied he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But mother carries them to Arles on Friday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sells them; and brings back nice, tender bread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt have been to Arles?”⁠—“Never!” she said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What, never been to Arles! But I’ve been there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, poor young lady! Couldst thou see how fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And large a city that same Arles is grown!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She covers all the seven mouths of the Rhone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the islands of the great salt-mere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her cattle graze: wild horses doth she rear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And in one summer, corn enough doth grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feed her seven full years, if need were so.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She’s fishermen who fish on every sea⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seamen who front the storms right valiantly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of distant waters.” Thus with pretty pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The boy his sunny country glorified,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In golden speech;⁠—her blue and heaving ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her Mont Majour, that keeps the mills in motion⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These with soft olives ever feeding fully;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her bitterns in the marshes booming dully.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One thing alone, thou lovely, dusky town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The child forgat⁠—of all thy charms the crown;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said not, fruitful Arles, that thy fine air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives to thy daughters beauty rich and rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As grapes to autumn, or as wings to bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fragrance to the hill-sides. Him had heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The country maiden, sadly, absently.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now, “Bright boy, wilt thou not go with me?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She said; “for, ere the frogs croak in the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My foot must planted be beyond the billow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with me! I must o’er the Rhone be rowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left there in the keeping of my God!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now, then,” the urchin cried, “thou poor, dear lady,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou art in luck! for we are fishers,” said he;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And thou shalt sleep under our tent this night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitched in the shadow of the poplars white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So keeping all thy pretty clothing on;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And father, with the earliest ray of dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In our own little boat will put thee o’er!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she, “Do not detain me, I implore:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am yet strong enough this night to wander.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now God forbid!” was the lad’s prompt rejoinder:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wouldst thou see, then, the crowd of sorry shapes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Trau-de-la-Capo that escapes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if they meet thee, be thou sure of this⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ll drag thee with them into the abyss!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Trau-de-la-Capo! What may that be, pray?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I’ll tell thee, lady, as we pick our way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the stones.” And forthwith he began:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Once was a treading-floor that overran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With wealth of sheaves. To-morrow, on thy ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou’lt pass, upon the riverside, the place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Trod by a circle of Camargan steeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tall sheaves have been yielding up their seeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the incessant hoofs, a month or more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No pause, no rest; and, on the treading-floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dusty and winding, still the eye perceives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A very mountain of untrodden sheaves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Also, the weather was so fiercely hot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The floor would burn like fire; and rested not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wooden forks that more sheaves yet supplied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While at the horses’ muzzles there were shied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clusters of bearded ears unceasingly⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They flew as arrows from the cross-bow fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And on <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s day and on <abbr>St.</abbr> Charles’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rang, and rang vainly, all the bells of Arles:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was no Sunday and no holiday</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the unhappy horses: but alway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heavy tramp around the weary road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alway the pricking of the keeper’s goad,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alway the orders issued huskily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in the fiery whirlwind still stood he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greedy master of the treaders white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had even muzzled them, in his despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when Our Lady’s day in August came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The coupled beasts were treading, all the same,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The pilèd sheaves, foam-drenched. Their livers clung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fast to their ribs, and their jaws drivelling hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When suddenly an icy, northern gale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smit, swept the floor⁠—and God’s blasphemers pale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It quakes! It parts! On a black cauldron’s brink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now stand they, and their eyes with horror sink.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then the sheaves whirl with fury terrible.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitch-forkers, keepers, keepers-aids as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struggle to save them; but they naught can do:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The van, the van-goats, and the mill-stones too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horses and drivers, treading-floor, and master</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are swallowed up in one immense disaster!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You make me shudder!” poor Mirèio said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, but that is not all, my pretty maid!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou thinkest me a little mad, may be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on the morrow thou the spot wilt see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carp and tench in the blue water playing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in the reeds, marsh-blackbirds roundelaying.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But on Our Lady’s day, when mounts again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire-crowned sun to the meridian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay thee down softly, ear to earth,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And eye a-watch, and presently thou’lt see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gulf, at first so limpid, will begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To darken with the shadow of the sin;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And slowly up from the unquiet deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A murmuring sound, like buzzing flies, will creep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then a tinkling, as of tiny bells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That soon into an awful uproar swells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the water-weeds! Like human voices</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inside an amphora the fearsome noise is!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And then it is the trot of wasted horses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Painfully tramping round their weary courses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a hard, dry surface, evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Echoing like a summer threshing-floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom drives a brutal keeper, nothing loth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hurries them with insult and with oath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, when the holy sun is sinking low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blasphemies turn hoarse and fainter grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tinkling dies among the weeds. Far off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The limping, sorry steed is heard to cough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, on the top of the tall reeds a-swinging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once more the blackbirds begin sweetly singing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, full of chat, and with his basket laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travelled the little man before the maiden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the descending sun with rose invests</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great blue ramparts and the golden crests</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hill-range, peaceful and pure and high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blending its outline with the evening sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seemed the great orb, as he withdrew in splendour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God’s peace unto the marshes to surrender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the great lake, and the olives gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Vaulungo, and the Rhone away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in the distance, and the reapers weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now unbend, and quaff the sea-air, cheery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till the boy cries that far away he sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The home-tent’s canvas fluttering in the breeze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And the white poplar, dear maid, seest thou?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brother Not, who climbs it even now?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’s there after cicalas, be thou sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to spy me returning o’er the moor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah, now he sees us! And my sister Zeto,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who helped him with her shoulder, turns this way too;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seems to tell my mother that she may</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put on the bouillabaisse without delay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mother also, I can see her leaning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the boat, and the fresh fish a-gleaning.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, as the two made haste with one accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mount the dike, the lusty fisher roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now this is charming! Look this way, my wife!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our little Andreloun, upon my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will be the prince of fishers one day,” said he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For he has caught the queen of eels already!”</span>
